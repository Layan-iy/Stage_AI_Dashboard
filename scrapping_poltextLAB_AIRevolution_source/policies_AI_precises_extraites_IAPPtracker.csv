AUSTRALIA,"The Australian government highlighted the application of existing regulatory frameworks for AI. In 2021, the government released an AI Action Plan, which set out a plan to build AI capability and accelerate the development and adoption of trusted, secure and responsible AI technologies in Australia.
In August 2024, the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Resources released the Voluntary AI Safety Standard. This standard builds on the 2023 discussion paper ""Safe and Responsible AI in Australia"" to support and promote consistency among best practices when developing AI. While not mandatory, the standard consists of 10 guardrails, including testing, transparency and accountability requirements.
In September 2024, Australia's Digital Transformation Agency released its policy for the responsible use of AI in government. In this document, the government recognizes the potential benefits of AI and notes the public expects the government to use the technology safely and responsibly. According to the policy, government agencies must adopt several governance measures, such as naming an accountable official.","In 2021, the government released an AI Action Plan, which set out a plan to build AI capability and accelerate the development and adoption of trusted, secure and responsible AI technologies in Australia.",2021.0

BRAZIL,"Brazil published an AI Strategy, as well as a summary. The strategy proposes to finance research projects that apply ethical solutions, establish technical requirements that advance ethical applications, develop techniques to mitigate algorithmic bias, create parameters around human intervention where automated decisions may create high-risk situations, and implement codes of conduct to encourage traceability and safeguard legal rights. Brazil also strives to encourage data sharing per its data protection law, the LGPD, create an AI observatory for measuring impact and disseminate open- source codes for identifying discriminatory trends.
Brazil introduced a comprehensive AI bill, which emphasizes human rights and creates a civil liability regime for AI developers, to its Senate. The proposed AI bill would:
•  Prohibit certain ""excessive risk"" systems.
•  Establish a regulatory body to enforce the law.
•  Create civil liability for AI providers.
•  Require reporting obligations for significant security incidents.
•  Guarantee various individual rights, such as explanation, nondiscrimination, rectification of identified biases and due process mechanisms.
In July 2023, the country's DPA, the Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados, published a Preliminary Analysis of Bill No. 2338/2023, which provides for the use of AI in Brazil. Further, the ANPD has now published its final opinion on
