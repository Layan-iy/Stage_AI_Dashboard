Practical Applications of Research Agents and Tools;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jul 12, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/practical-applications-of-research-agents-and-tools/;framework;No sources found;"Research agents and tools represent a burgeoning field within artificial intelligence, where autonomous systems leverage large language models (LLMs) and modular architectures to facilitate scientific inquiry and innovation. These agents operate by integrating perception, reasoning, planning, and action capabilities, enabling them to perform tasks such as literature review, hypothesis generation, data analysis, and experimental design (Gridach et al. 2025). Their development draws from advancements in LLMs, which provide natural language interfaces for interaction and decision-making, allowing for general-purpose assistance across domains (Cheng et al. 2024). Practical applications span automation of repetitive research processes, enhancement of accuracy in data interpretation, and acceleration of discoveries in fields like biology, chemistry, and machine learning (Zhou et al. 2025). By minimising human error and optimising resource allocation, these systems promise to transform traditional workflows into more efficient, scalable operations. One prominent application lies in automating the full research pipeline, from ideation to reporting. Frameworks enable agents to handle literature reviews by searching and synthesising vast databases, followed by experimentation through code generation and simulation, culminating in structured reports. For instance, agents can achieve state-of-the-art performance in machine learning tasks while reducing costs by up to 84% compared to prior methods, allowing researchers to focus on creative aspects rather than routine coding (Schmidgall et al. 2025). In scientific discovery, agents facilitate hypothesis generation and experiment conduction in domains such as materials science, where they analyse genomic data or protein structures to extract insights (Gridach et al. 2025). Tools like modular architectures support multi-hop information retrieval and iterative tool use, making agents adaptable to complex, multi-turn tasks (Huang et al. 2025). Such capabilities prove invaluable in accelerating progress, as agents process multimodal inputs—including text, images, and code—to produce comprehensive outputs. In machine learning research, agents serve as benchmarks and frameworks for evaluating and advancing AI systems. Environments simulate real-world challenges across computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, where agents generate hypotheses, implement models, and iterate on results (Nathani et al. 2025). Search policies, such as greedy or evolutionary algorithms, navigate solution spaces to optimise performance, achieving higher success rates in competitive settings like Kaggle competitions (Toledo et al. 2025). These applications extend to automated model training, where agents refine hyperparameters and adapt to dynamic environments, fostering continual learning (Liu et al. 2025). By generating synthetic data at scale and integrating new tasks, such tools enhance the development of robust AI ecosystems, applicable in industry for workflow optimisation and resource management. Multi-agent systems further expand practical utility through collaboration and collective intelligence. Configurations involve multiple roles, message passing, and strategies to mitigate communication barriers, mirroring human social dynamics in research teams (Cheng et al. 2024). In enterprise settings, agents handle customer support, scheduling, and data summarisation, while in specialised domains like finance or healthcare, they optimise decision-making across trading systems or patient data analysis. Evolutionary mechanisms allow agents to self-improve, incorporating feedback loops for adaptive evolution and ethical alignment, ensuring safe deployment in real-world scenarios (Liu et al. 2025). Benchmarks assess information discovery, selection, and organisation, revealing opportunities for improvement in organising knowledge into hierarchical structures like mind-maps (Kang and Xiong 2024). Challenges in implementation highlight the need for balanced evaluations beyond accuracy, incorporating cost, robustness, and reproducibility. Current benchmarks often overlook efficiency, leading to overly complex agents that overfit to specific tasks (Kapoor et al. 2024). Joint optimisation of metrics reduces unnecessary expenditures, while standardised practices address overfitting through principled holdout sets. Real-world deployments underscore versatility across sectors. In biology, agents automate hypothesis testing from biomedical literature, navigating vast datasets to propose novel experiments (Gridach et al. 2025). Economic applications include market analysis and forecasting, where agents utilise tool integration for data processing and prediction (Cheng et al. 2024). Software development benefits from code generation and debugging, streamlining innovation in agile environments. Security considerations, such as mitigating intrinsic threats and ensuring value alignment, are paramount for trustworthy systems in sensitive areas like public safety (Zhou et al. 2025). The trajectory of research agents points towards enhanced human-AI collaboration, with prospects for foundational advancements in autonomous systems. As agents evolve to incorporate brain-inspired modules and evolutionary strategies, their role in scientific and industrial innovation will likely expand, driving efficiency and novel insights. Continued focus on benchmarks and ethical frameworks will ensure these tools contribute positively to knowledge advancement.  References: 1.

Types of AI Agents;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jul 10, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/types-of-ai-agents/;framework;No sources found;"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are broadly defined as computational entities that perceive their environment and act autonomously to achieve specific goals (Russell & Norvig 2020). Foundational work in the field, dating back to its early formalisation, characterises intelligent agents by key properties such as autonomy, reactivity, proactiveness, and social ability, which collectively define their capacity for intelligent behaviour (Wooldridge & Jennings 1995). This theoretical groundwork established a framework for understanding how agents operate. Within classical AI, a highly influential taxonomy proposed by Russell and Norvig (2020) groups agents into classes of increasing sophistication, from simple reflex agents to complex learning agents. More recently, however, the advent of large-scale machine learning has introduced new agent paradigms. This shift has been profoundly influenced by architectural breakthroughs like the Transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017), which underpins the large language models (LLMs) at the heart of contemporary agents. These modern systems are often distinguished by their ability to handle multiple data modalities, utilise external software tools, and operate within collaborative multi-agent systems (Masterman et al. 2024). This essay provides an overview of this evolution, from the classical agent types to the modern, LLM-driven architectures that are shaping the future of AI. The most elementary agent type is the simple reflex agent, which operates on a straightforward condition-action principle. It selects actions based solely on the current percept, ignoring any perceptual history, by implementing a set of predefined rules that map observed conditions directly to responses. While computationally efficient in fully observable environments, such as a basic thermostat, this purely reactive behaviour is brittle; in complex or partially observable settings, it can lead to incorrect actions or infinite loops. To overcome these limitations, model-based reflex agents maintain an internal state that functions as a model of the world, updated by the percept history. This internal model allows the agent to handle partial observability by encoding unobserved aspects of the current situation, such as remembering the last known location of an object that is currently out of sight, enabling more informed decision-making (Russell & Norvig 2020). A further level of sophistication is introduced with goal-based agents, which move beyond reactive behaviour by incorporating an explicit representation of goals, or desirable states. In addition to a world model, these agents use search and planning algorithms to find sequences of actions that will lead to their goal states. This makes them far more flexible than reflex agents, as they can adapt their plans if circumstances change. Decision-making can be refined even further with utility-based agents, which employ a utility function to evaluate the desirability of different world states. Instead of a binary goal, the agent has a quantitative performance measure it seeks to maximise, allowing it to handle trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting, objectives, such as speed versus safety in an autonomous vehicle (Russell & Norvig 2020). The learning agent represents a significant leap, as it is designed to improve its performance over time by learning from experience (Russell & Norvig 2020). A learning agent contains a 'learning element' that uses feedback on its actions to modify its 'performance element', thereby adapting to new or unknown environments. Reinforcement learning is a key paradigm here, in which an agent refines its policies to maximise a cumulative reward signal (Sutton & Barto 2018). The success of DeepMind's AlphaGo, which learned superhuman strategies through self-play, powerfully demonstrated the potential of learning agents to surpass their initial programming and even human expertise (Silver et al. 2016). The most recent and profound shift in agent design has been driven by the emergence of LLM-based agents. These leverage the advanced reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models, which are themselves built upon powerful neural architectures like the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017), as a core decision-making engine (Deng et al. 2025). An LLM-based agent can interpret high-level natural language instructions, decompose complex tasks using reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (Wei et al. 2022), and execute multi-step plans in an interactive loop of planning, acting, and observing (Yao et al. 2023). Unlike a reactive chatbot, these agents exhibit proactivity and autonomy, pursuing long-horizon goals with minimal continuous user input (Kolt 2025). As real-world tasks often involve more than just text, multimodal agents have become a critical area of development. These agents are capable of processing and generating information across multiple modalities, including images, audio, and video, by combining LLMs with specialised perception models. This allows them to tackle more intricate and nuanced tasks, such as analysing a diagram and producing a textual summary (Xie et al. 2024). Building on these capabilities, collaborative multi-agent systems address problems that are too complex for a single agent. In these systems, a task is distributed among multiple, often specialised, agents that work together as a team (Masterman et al. 2024). This concept draws on decades of research into multi-agent systems, where coordination and communication are paramount (Wooldridge & Jennings 1995). Modern frameworks may assign distinct roles—such as ‘planner’, ‘executor’, or ‘critic’—and rely on structured communication protocols to ensure coherent collaboration (Gao et al. 2024). To avoid inefficient ""chatter,"" some systems like MetaGPT require agents to exchange structured outputs rather than unstructured messages (Masterman et al. 2024). Finally, tool-using agents overcome the inherent limitations of LLMs, such as static knowledge and an inability to interact with the outside world, by invoking external tools. These agents can call APIs, query databases, or run code to access real-time information and execute actions in digital environments (Masterman et al. 2024). Seminal work like Toolformer has shown that language models can be trained to seamlessly integrate such tool calls into their reasoning processes, effectively giving them the ability to act upon the world (Schick et al. 2023).

The Act contains comprehensive reforms to the current UK General Data Protection Regulation and Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, while placing special emphasis on digital identities and secure access to smart data sets. The legislative amendment package, put forward by the Labour Party in October 2024, includes several key innovations, such as the statutory definition of ""scientific research,"" the introduction of the concept of ""recognised legitimate interests,"" and modifications to rules on automated decision-making, removing the requirement to establish a qualifying lawful basis before conducting automated decision making, except where special category data is used. The Act introduces changes in numerous specific areas, although it is not expected to have a significant impact on the day-to-day compliance practices of most businesses. The new legislation contains reforms to rules on cookie consent, aligns the enforcement mechanisms of the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, and clarifies the United Kingdom's position on international transfers of personal data and the conduct of adequacy assessments. A notable institutional change is the renaming of the Information Commissioner's Office to the Information Commission, as well as the introduction of a formal Board structure with an appointed CEO. In the final stages of the Act's passage through Parliament, debates centered around amendments proposed by the House of Lords aimed at ensuring transparency around data scraping and the use of text and data to train AI models, but these amendments were ultimately dropped as the government argued this issue should not be dealt with within the framework of the current Act. The adoption of the new Act is crucial for the December review of the data adequacy agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom. Although several European civil society organizations, including the Open Rights Group and European Digital Rights, expressed concerns about the United Kingdom's data protection standards in an open letter to EU Justice Commissioner Michael McGrath, the UK government does not consider the agreement to be at risk. According to Debbie Heywood, senior counsel at law firm Taylor Wessing, the government insists that nothing in the Data (Use and Access) Act jeopardises the EU adequacy decision, and so far neither the European Data Protection Board nor the European Commission have signaled serious danger, although they emphasized that they will be closely monitoring developments. Beyond the Data (Use and Access) Act, the UK Investigatory Powers Act and recent news that the government required Apple to circumvent encryption protections for users could potentially pose a greater problem for the EU adequacy assessment.

What Are AI Agents and How Do They Work?;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jul 6, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/what-are-ai-agents-and-how-do-they-work/;framework, governance;No sources found;"A paradigm shift is taking place in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), moving from generative models that create synthetic content towards autonomous AI agents. These agents are capable of realising complex, open-ended goals with minimal human intervention (Kolt 2025). An AI agent is fundamentally a computational entity that uses large language models (LLMs) as its ""brain"" to perceive its environment, reason, plan, and act to achieve a specific goal (Deng et al. 2025). This definition represents a significant advance from traditional systems limited to narrower tasks, opening up new possibilities where AI is not merely a tool but an active collaborator in complex problem-solving. These advanced systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in the research field, where some refer to them as an ""AI co-scientist"" (Gottweis et al. 2025). Understanding the core principles, operational mechanisms, and types of agents is crucial for assessing the potential inherent in current and future AI applications. The fundamental operational framework of an AI agent is built upon an iterative cycle, which consists of several closely interconnected modules. According to the consensus in modern literature, these modules are: perception, reasoning and planning, action, and memory (Xie et al., 2024;Sapkota et al., 2025). The perception module is responsible for processing and interpreting multimodal (textual, visual, auditory, etc.) information from the environment. The reasoning and planning module, which typically incorporates an LLM or a large multimodal model (LMM), is responsible for decomposing tasks, defining sub-goals, and developing a plan of action. This ""thinking"" process often employs techniques such as ""Chain-of-Thought"" (CoT), which breaks down a problem into steps for more logical deduction (Masterman et al. 2024). The action module executes the plan, most often with the help of external tools, such as APIs, web search engines, or code execution environments. Finally, the memory module enables the agent to retain context, learn from previous interactions, and maintain state during long-term tasks (Xie et al. 2024). One of the most important directions in the development of AI agents is the increase in architectural complexity, leading from simpler, single-agent systems to sophisticated, multi-agent ""agentic AI"" systems (Sapkota et al. 2025). Single-agent architectures employ a single agent that independently executes the cycles of planning, action, and self-reflection. Such systems, like the ReAct or Reflexion patterns, perform well on clearly defined problems where the task can be solved through iterative refinement and self-correction (Masterman et al. 2024). In contrast, multi-agent systems (or agentic AI) represent a fundamental paradigm shift, where multiple agents endowed with specialised roles (""personas"") collaborate to achieve a common goal. These systems are capable of dynamic task-sharing, the coordination of specialised knowledge, and the management of complex, parallelisable workflows (Sapkota et al. 2025). For instance, collaborative models are at the core of systems that automate systematic literature reviews (Sami et al. 2024) and those that assist in scientific research, often referred to as ""AI co-scientists"" (Gottweis et al. 2025). The key to the operation of multi-agent systems is effective coordination and communication. Architectures can be vertical (hierarchical), where a lead agent directs the others, or horizontal, where agents collaborate as equals, for instance, within a debate or discussion framework (Masterman et al. 2024). The ""generate, debate, and evolve"" model presented by Gottweis et al. (2025) is an excellent example of horizontal collaboration, where agents refine and develop hypotheses during simulated scientific debates. This critical-reflective step is essential for increasing reliability and filtering out errors (e.g., ""hallucinations""). Ensuring an effective flow of information, for example through ""publish-subscribe"" mechanisms, prevents unnecessary communication noise and ensures that each agent only accesses information relevant to it (Masterman et al. 2024). In summary, AI agents represent the forefront of artificial intelligence development, moving beyond mere content generation and into the realm of autonomous action and problem-solving. Their fundamental operation is based on an iterative cycle of perception, reasoning, planning, and action, enabled by the integration of LLMs and external tools. The shift from single-agent models to complex, collaborative, agentic AI systems results in increasingly sophisticated capabilities, which are able to automate scientific discoveries (Gao et al. 2024) and other complex tasks. Although the technology still faces numerous challenges, including in the areas of reliability, evaluation (Kapoor et al. 2024), security (Deng et al. 2025), and governance (Kolt 2025), AI agents are already reshaping our interactions with the digital environment and are increasingly functioning as an extension of human creativity and expertise, rather than as mere replacements.

The Italian authority has also initiated a separate proceeding to assess whether Replika's AI training methods comply with EU privacy regulations, particularly regarding the legal basis for processing throughout the AI system's lifecycle. Launched in 2017 by San Francisco-based Luka Inc., Replika is an AI application offering customised virtual companions that can serve as confidants, therapists, romantic partners, or mentors, marketed as improving users' emotional wellbeing. Technical assessments revealed that the company's current age verification system remains deficient in several respects, despite the company's declaration that minors are excluded from potential users. In addition to the fine, the Garante ordered the company to bring its data processing operations into compliance with GDPR provisions, with particular focus on establishing proper legal grounds and transparency measures. The significance of this case extends beyond the specific penalty and signals stricter regulation of AI systems in the EU. The Garante is one of the most proactive EU regulatory authorities in assessing AI platform compliance, having fined OpenAI €15 million for ChatGPT last year after briefly banning its use in Italy in 2023.

Judge Leonie Brinkema stated in her 115-page decision that the company unlawfully tied its DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) ad server platform and AdX ad exchange together, excluding competitors. This ruling marks the second of three significant monopoly cases that the U.S. government has won against Google in the past year. The court partially upheld the Justice Department (DOJ) and eight states' lawsuit filed in January 2023, which alleged that Google's $31 billion advertising business operates illegally. Court documents show that Google strengthened its monopoly position through its acquisitions of DoubleClick in 2008 and AdMeld in 2011, enabling it to raise ad prices and reduce publisher revenues. Judge Brinkema, however, rejected one of the DOJ's claims that the company also maintains a monopoly in the so-called ""open-web display advertiser ad networks"" market. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, announced that the company will appeal part of the ruling. The next step will be a court hearing to determine appropriate remedies, which could include forcing Google to divest parts of its advertising business, such as selling off the Google Ad Manager. This decision is part of a larger regulatory wave targeting big tech companies, including Meta, Amazon, and Apple, which are also facing antitrust lawsuits. William Kovacic, a competition law professor at The George Washington University, suggested that the partial victory reduces the likelihood of a breakup, but Google still faces potentially significant operational restrictions.

Renewed AI Principles at Google: Removing the Weapons Ban and Prioritising Global Security;poltextLAB AI journalist;Mar 5, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/renewed-ai-principles-at-google-removing-the-weapons-ban-and-prioritising-global-security/;policy, framework, strategy;Title: Responsible AI: Our 2024 report and ongoing work, Author: Google, URL: https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Google releases responsible AI report while removing its anti-weapons pledge, Author: ZDNET, URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-releases-responsible-ai-report-while-removing-its-anti-weapons-pledge/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Google ditched its pledge not to use AI for weapons and surveillance, Author: Quartz, URL: https://qz.com/google-ai-principles-weapons-surveillance-responsible-1851755705?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com;"Google removed its previous policy prohibiting the use of artificial intelligence for weapons purposes in February 2025, coinciding with the release of its annual Responsible AI report. The company's new AI principles are built on three main pillars: bold innovation, responsible development and deployment, and progress based on collaboration. The significant change is part of a broader strategic shift aimed at strengthening the leading role of democratic countries in AI development. Google's AI responsibility reports (Responsible AI Progress Report), published since 2018, have evolved considerably. The latest 2024 report contains more than 300 research studies on responsible AI and documents the company's $120 million investment in AI education and training worldwide. The report details safety measures, including SynthID content authentication technology and updates to the Frontier Safety Framework, which contains new safety recommendations and procedures for managing the risks of misleading AI systems. In its blog post, the company emphasised that companies, governments, and organisations upholding democratic values must work together to create AI solutions that protect people and support global growth and national security. The modified guidelines and the removal of the weapons ban signal a significant change in the company's strategy, particularly because Google introduced the original restrictions in 2018 after deciding not to renew its participation in the Pentagon's Project Maven programme. While maintaining this change of direction, the company's safety and quality standards have nonetheless remained high: Google Cloud AI received a ""mature"" rating in the NIST Risk Management framework, and the company obtained ISO/IEC 42001 certification for its Gemini application, Google Cloud, and Google Workspace services. The report emphasises that the company continues to evaluate the benefits and risks of AI projects, but now approaches the question of national security applications from a broader perspective.

The Indispensable Role of Domain Expertise in Validating Generative AI Outputs;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jul 2, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-indispensable-role-of-domain-expertise-in-validating-generative-ai-outputs/;framework;No sources found;"The allure of generative AI's apparent competence has led many researchers to venture into unfamiliar territories, applying these tools to domains where they lack the necessary expertise to critically evaluate the outputs. This phenomenon represents a fundamental departure from traditional research practices, where domain knowledge serves as the cornerstone of methodological rigour and result interpretation. The consequences of this shift extend beyond individual research projects, potentially undermining the broader scientific enterprise through the propagation of unvalidated or erroneous findings. Central to addressing these challenges is the recognition that domain expertise is not merely beneficial but essential for the reliable evaluation of generative AI outputs (Asamoah et al. 2024). The complexity of modern AI systems, combined with their propensity for producing plausible yet potentially inaccurate results, necessitates a fundamental reconsideration of how we approach AI-assisted research. This analysis demonstrates that domain expertise is indispensable for validating generative AI outputs, requiring researchers to exercise heightened caution when applying AI tools outside their areas of competence. The imperative extends to implementing robust validation protocols that prioritise human oversight and critical evaluation of both AI processes and outputs, ensuring that the promise of AI-assisted research does not compromise the fundamental principles of scholarly rigour. The role of domain expertise in evaluating generative AI outputs transcends simple fact-checking to encompass nuanced understanding of contextual appropriateness, methodological soundness, and disciplinary conventions (Dash et al. 2022). Gallegos et al. (2024) provide compelling evidence for the multifaceted nature of bias in large language models, demonstrating that effective evaluation requires not only technical understanding of AI systems but also deep knowledge of the specific domains in which these systems operate. Their comprehensive survey reveals that bias evaluation must account for different levels of model operation—embeddings, probabilities, and generated text—each requiring distinct forms of domain-specific expertise to assess effectively. The interpretability challenge represents a particularly complex aspect of domain-expert evaluation (Bayer et al. 2022). Unlike traditional research tools whose limitations and biases are well-understood within specific disciplines, generative AI systems operate through complex neural architectures that obscure their decision-making processes. Domain experts must therefore develop new competencies that combine their existing disciplinary knowledge with an understanding of AI system behaviour. This requirement extends beyond surface-level output evaluation to encompass critical examination of the underlying processes that generate AI responses, including training data provenance, model architecture influences, and potential sources of systematic error. The inadequacy of general AI evaluation metrics becomes apparent when considering domain-specific requirements for accuracy and appropriateness. Standard metrics such as perplexity, BLEU scores, or coherence measures may indicate technical proficiency whilst failing to capture domain-specific errors that could fundamentally compromise the validity of AI-generated content (Chang et al. 2024). For instance, a generative AI system might produce a scientifically coherent-sounding explanation of a biological process that contains subtle but critical errors in mechanism description, errors that would be immediately apparent to a domain expert but might escape detection through general evaluation protocols. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of knowledge within specific domains necessitates ongoing expert involvement in AI evaluation processes. Scientific understanding evolves continuously, with new discoveries potentially invalidating previously accepted theories or methodologies. Domain experts possess the contextual awareness necessary to identify when AI-generated content reflects outdated or superseded knowledge, a capability that cannot be replicated through automated evaluation systems. This temporal dimension of expertise underscores the irreplaceable role of human domain knowledge in maintaining the currency and accuracy of AI-assisted research outputs. Researchers using generative AI tools must avoid venturing into domains where they lack sufficient expertise (Peskoff and Stewart 2023). When working with AI outputs, particularly in analytical contexts, researchers must examine the underlying processes by opening analysis sections and reviewing the code to understand what the model has done. If researchers lack the domain expertise necessary for validation, they must not blindly trust the model's outputs, regardless of how confident these appear. AI models can make errors, producing plausible-sounding but fundamentally incorrect results that only knowledgeable human oversight can identify. Effective AI oversight requires active validation rather than passive acceptance of outputs. This involves systematic examination of AI results against domain-specific criteria, verification of methodologies, and critical assessment of accuracy. Researchers must engage with AI systems as tools that augment rather than replace human expertise, maintaining essential human supervision for checking and validating all AI-generated content. Without proper validation protocols and domain expertise, the apparent sophistication of AI outputs can mask underlying inaccuracies or methodological flaws (Peskoff and Stewart 2023). In sum, domain expertise is indispensable for reliable evaluation of generative AI outputs, and researchers must resist the temptation to apply AI systems to unfamiliar domains without adequate validation capabilities. Generative AI systems are sophisticated tools that require expert guidance rather than autonomous agents, necessitating systematic validation protocols and human oversight to identify errors, biases, and limitations that automated systems cannot detect. The research community must implement robust validation mechanisms and prioritise domain expertise in AI evaluation processes to harness AI capabilities whilst safeguarding research integrity and scholarly knowledge.

Formulating Research Questions and Hypotheses: From Philosophical Foundations to AI-Assisted Approaches;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jun 30, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/formulating-research-questions-and-hypotheses-from-philosophical-foundations-to-ai-assisted-approaches/;framework;No sources found;"The formulation of research questions and hypotheses constitutes a fundamental aspect of scientific inquiry, providing a structured pathway for investigating phenomena and advancing knowledge. Research questions articulate specific gaps or uncertainties within a domain, whereas hypotheses propose tentative explanations or predictions amenable to empirical scrutiny. These elements ensure methodological rigour and facilitate the progression from observation to generalisation across disciplines. Philosophical perspectives on hypothesis formulation emphasise the necessity of testability and refutation. Karl Popper advanced the criterion of falsifiability as a demarcation principle distinguishing scientific theories from non-scientific ones, positing that genuine scientific hypotheses must be incompatible with certain possible observations, thereby rendering them potentially (Thornton 2023). This approach, encapsulated in the method of conjecture and refutation, advocates the generation of bold conjectures followed by rigorous attempts at disconfirmation, rather than inductive verification, to mitigate biases and promote critical rationalism. Hypotheses, in this framework, derive from creative imagination and must exhibit high informative content, enabling risky predictions that invite empirical challenge. Such principles underscore the provisional nature of scientific knowledge, where corroborated theories approximate truthlikeness until supplanted by superior alternatives. Traditional methods for developing research questions and hypotheses involve systematic steps, beginning with literature reviews to uncover unresolved issues. Researchers refine broad topics into focused questions that are specific, measurable, and feasible, often formulating hypotheses as null or alternative statements to support quantitative analysis. Nonetheless, these methods encounter limitations in handling voluminous data or interdisciplinary complexities, where human cognitive constraints may impede comprehensive exploration. Artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly transformed the formulation of research questions and hypotheses, leveraging computational capabilities to generate novel propositions, accelerate validation, and explore vast combinatorial spaces. Large language models (LLMs) drive this shift by synthesising extensive literature and datasets, identifying hidden patterns, and proposing conjectures with minimal human input (Huang et al. 2025). Comprehensive surveys outline LLM-based methods, including basic prompting for initial ideas, adversarial approaches to spur innovation, and multi-agent systems that mimic academic debate for refinement (Alkan et al. 2025). For example, frameworks like MOOSE-Chem adapt LLMs to specific domains, generating hypotheses from molecular data, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) reduces hallucinations by grounding outputs in reliable sources (Yang et al. 2024). Generative AI further automates extraction from big data using unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs, uncovering associations in genomics and neuroscience, such as genetic-protein links or novel drug targets in conditions like pulmonary fibrosis, thereby shortening discovery timelines from years to months. The POPPER framework deploys LLM agents to conduct sequential falsification experiments, testing hypotheses' implications with strict error controls across fields like biology and sociology, matching human expert performance while drastically cutting validation time. Autonomous verification tools evaluate LLM outputs in controlled environments, highlighting strengths in independent ideation despite logical gaps (Huang et al. 2025). Benchmarks such as HypoBench provide systematic assessments of LLM hypothesis generation, balancing novelty against coherence to inform improvements (Liu et al. 2025). Innovative architectures support interactive and autonomous workflows. The IRIS system blends human oversight with AI for iterative hypothesis refinement via hybrid intelligence (Garikaparthi et al. 2025). In biomedicine, tools like GPT-4o craft hypotheses for challenges such as cardiotoxicity, while hybrid causal graphs and LLMs enable testable ideas in behavioural studies (Li et al. 2025). Autonomous agents like AI-Researcher manage end-to-end pipelines, from question formulation to evaluation, using Monte Carlo tree search for optimised prioritisation (Tang et al. 2025). Generative setups in self-driving laboratories refine hypotheses through feedback loops, simulating interventions and causal inference for counterfactual testing (Canty et al. 2025). AI also aids interdisciplinary tasks, such as drafting proposals with creativity evaluations. Such modalities offer key benefits, including enhanced efficiency in hypothesis exploration and broader access to scientific innovation, by boosting the odds of viable conjectures in limited settings. However, challenges include interpretability issues, bias inheritance from training data, and risks of eroding human critical thinking through over-reliance (Alkan et al. 2025). Ethical guidelines stress transparency in AI application to uphold reproducibility and accountability (Resnik and Hosseini 2024). In conclusion, the integration of Karl Popper's falsifiability principle with AI-driven methodologies represents a significant advancement in formulating research questions and hypotheses, combining philosophical rigour with computational efficiency to generate and validate propositions more rapidly. AI systems, such as large language models and agentic frameworks like POPPER, enable the synthesis of vast datasets, uncovering novel insights in fields like biomedicine while automating validation through sequential testing. This synergy accelerates scientific discovery, and bridges gaps in traditional methods, particularly in complex, data-intensive domains. However, to maximise benefits, ethical considerations must address biases, interpretability, and reproducibility, ensuring human oversight complements AI capabilities.  References: 1.

Amodei stated that companies and the government are ""sugarcoating"" the risks of AI whilst most workers remain unaware of the impending changes. According to a 2024 report by venture capital firm SignalFire, Big Tech hiring of new graduates has dropped 50% from pre-pandemic levels, partly due to AI adoption. In 2024, early-career candidates accounted for just 7% of total hires at Big Tech firms, down by 25% from 2023, whilst at startups, that figure is merely 6%, an 11% decrease from the previous year. Heather Doshay, a partner at SignalFire, noted that AI is doing what interns and new grads used to do, but emphasised that AI isn't stealing entire job categories outright—it's absorbing the lowest-skill tasks, shifting the burden to universities, boot camps, and candidates to level up faster. Amodei proposed concrete solutions, including spreading public awareness of the incoming change, developing AI literacy, and preparing policymakers to develop solutions for an economy where superintelligence is a reality. The Anthropic Economic Index released in February 2025 showed that AI use currently leans more towards augmentation (57%), enhancing human processes, which Amodei describes as a short-term strategy since in the long term, everything humans do is eventually going to be done by AI systems.

The report aims to promote the safe development of AI technologies through empirical, science-based analysis while ensuring California maintains its leadership in the industry. Its significance stems from the fact that the state is home to 32 of the world’s top 50 AI companies, meaning its regulatory decisions carry global influence. The expert group appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom—including Dr. Fei-Fei Li, often referred to as the ""Godmother of AI,"" Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Dr. Jennifer Tour Chayes, Dean at UC Berkeley—put forward specific recommendations for lawmakers. These include increasing transparency for advanced AI models, mandating the disclosure of risks and vulnerabilities, and introducing independent third-party evaluations. The report underscores that AI could cause severe and, in some cases, potentially irreversible harm without adequate safety measures. The public was invited to submit comments on the report until 8 April, with finalisation expected in the summer. The draft report primarily focuses on so-called frontier models representing the most advanced AI systems, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or China’s DeepSeek R1. Anthropic, a California-based frontier AI company itself, welcomed the report, noting that many of its recommendations already align with industry best practices. In a statement, Anthropic supported efforts by governments to enhance the transparency of AI companies’ safety practices and indicated that, based on their projections, even more advanced AI systems could emerge by the end of 2026, underscoring the urgency of swiftly establishing an appropriate regulatory framework.

The ""Claude Gov"" models were built based on direct government feedback to address real-world operational needs while undergoing the same rigorous safety testing as Anthropic's other Claude models. The new models deliver enhanced performance in handling classified materials, refuse less when engaging with classified information, and provide a greater understanding of documents within intelligence and defense contexts. Anthropic is not the only leading AI developer securing US defense contracts - OpenAI, Meta, and Google are also working on similar national security projects. The company teamed up with Palantir and AWS (Amazon's cloud computing division) in November to sell its AI technology to defense customers as it seeks dependable new revenue sources. The Claude Gov models' specialised capabilities include enhanced proficiency in languages and dialects critical to national security operations and improved interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently expressed concerns about proposed legislation that would grant a decade-long freeze on state regulation of AI.

The research revealed a significant class divide in AI usage: 52% of private school children use generative AI compared to 18% of state school children. The study found that children with additional learning needs use ChatGPT at higher rates (78% vs 53%) and typically employ the tools for communication and connection purposes. Dr Mhairi Aitken, Senior Ethics Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, states that children have important and nuanced opinions about the benefits and risks of generative AI, and it is crucial to listen to their perspectives. Parents show concern with 82% worried about children accessing inappropriate information through AI use, whilst 76% are concerned about impacts on critical thinking skills. The research demonstrates that children are already sophisticated users making deliberate choices about when and how to engage with these systems, preferring tactile, offline art materials over generative AI for creative tasks. Stephen Morgan, Department for Education Minister for Early Education, emphasised that child-centred policy making is at the heart of their mission to give every child the best start in life. Anna Rafferty, Senior Vice President of Digital Consumer Engagement at the LEGO Group, stated that every child should be empowered to experience the benefits of play safely both online and offline.

Misinformation and the Role of Generative AI Models in Its Spread;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 22, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/misinformation-and-the-role-of-generative-ai-models-in-its-spread/;policy, framework;No sources found;"Misinformation, defined as false or misleading information disseminated regardless of intent, poses significant challenges to societal trust and democratic processes (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017). Unlike disinformation, which involves deliberate deception, misinformation encompasses a broader spectrum, including unintentional errors, rumours, and misinterpretations. The advent GenAI models, capable of producing human-like text, images, and videos, has amplified the scale and complexity of misinformation. Misinformation thrives in environments of uncertainty, where incomplete or ambiguous information prompts individuals to fill gaps with assumptions or unverified claims (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). It can manifest in various forms, such as fabricated news stories, manipulated images, or misleading scientific claims. The spread of misinformation is facilitated by cognitive biases, including confirmation bias, where individuals favour information aligning with pre-existing beliefs (Nickerson, 1998). Social media platforms, with their rapid information-sharing capabilities, exacerbate this issue by creating echo chambers that reinforce false narratives (Bakshy et al., 2015). GenAI models, trained on vast datasets, can generate coherent text, realistic images, and even deepfake videos with minimal human input (Brown et al. 2020). While designed for applications like creative writing, education, and customer service, their capabilities have raised concerns about misuse. The accessibility of GenAI tools, often available through open-source platforms or public APIs, democratises content creation but also lowers barriers for producing misleading material (Buchanan et al. 2021). The strength of GenAI lies in its ability to mimic human communication, making its outputs difficult to distinguish from authentic content. For example, LLMs can craft persuasive narratives or fabricated academic papers, while image-generation models can produce photorealistic depictions of non-existent events. This realism enhances the potential for misinformation to deceive audiences, particularly when combined with the viral nature of online platforms. GenAI models contribute to misinformation in several ways. First, they enable the rapid production of false content at scale. A single user can generate thousands of misleading social media posts or articles in minutes, overwhelming fact-checking efforts (Vosoughi et al. 2018). For instance, during the 2024 US presidential election, AI-generated deepfake videos of candidates making false statements circulated widely, influencing voter perceptions (Hsu and Thompson, 2024). Such content, often tailored to exploit emotional triggers, spreads faster than factual information due to its novelty and shareability (Vosoughi et al. 2018). Second, GenAI can amplify existing misinformation by rephrasing or reformatting it to evade detection. Content moderation systems, designed to flag known false narratives, struggle to identify paraphrased or visually altered versions produced by AI (Buchanan et al. 2021). This adaptability makes GenAI a powerful tool for actors seeking to bypass platform safeguards, whether for ideological, financial, or malicious purposes. Third, GenAI’s outputs can inadvertently perpetuate misinformation when trained on biased or inaccurate datasets. If a model’s training data includes misleading information, it may reproduce these errors in its outputs, presenting them as factual (Brown et al. 2020). For example, early LLMs occasionally generated incorrect historical or scientific claims, reflecting biases in their training corpora. While improvements in data curation have mitigated this issue, the risk persists, particularly for models with less rigorous oversight. Addressing the role of GenAI in misinformation requires a multifaceted approach. Technologically, developers can implement safeguards, such as watermarking AI-generated content or restricting access to high-risk models (Buchanan et al. 2021). However, watermarking can be removed, and open-source models are widely available. Policy interventions, such as regulations mandating transparency in AI-generated content, could enhance accountability, though global enforcement is challenging (Paris and Donovan 2019). Education plays a critical role in equipping individuals to critically evaluate information. Media literacy programmes, emphasizing source verification and bias awareness, can reduce susceptibility to misinformation (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). Platforms must also strengthen content moderation, leveraging AI to detect and flag misleading content while balancing free expression. Collaborative efforts between governments, tech companies, and civil society are essential to establish standards for responsible AI use. The proliferation of GenAI-driven misinformation raises ethical questions about the responsibilities of developers and users. Should developers be held accountable for misuse of their models, or does responsibility lie with those who deploy them maliciously? The democratisation of GenAI empowers creativity but also risks enabling harm, highlighting the need for ethical frameworks to guide its development and use (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017). Societally, the erosion of trust in information sources threatens democratic institutions and social cohesion. When individuals cannot distinguish truth from falsehood, public discourse suffers, and polarisation intensifies (Bakshy et al., 2015). Addressing this challenge requires not only technological and policy solutions but also a cultural shift towards valuing evidence-based reasoning. In sum, misinformation, a pervasive issue rooted in human cognition and amplified by digital platforms, has been transformed by the capabilities of GenAI models. These models, while offering unprecedented creative potential, facilitate the rapid production and dissemination of false content, challenging efforts to maintain information integrity. By understanding the mechanisms through which GenAI contributes to misinformation, stakeholders can develop targeted strategies to mitigate its impact. Combining technological innovation, policy reform, and public education offers a path forward, ensuring that the benefits of GenAI are harnessed without compromising trust in the information ecosystem.

Ethical and Responsible Use of Generative AI in Research: Overview of EU and International Guidelines;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jun 10, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/ethical-and-responsible-use-of-generative-ai-in-research-overview-of-eu-and-international-guidelines/;policy, framework, governance, strategy;No sources found;"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into research environments has fundamentally transformed how scholars approach knowledge creation, data analysis, and academic writing. As these powerful technologies become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, they offer unprecedented opportunities for enhancing research productivity and enabling novel discoveries. However, their deployment simultaneously introduces complex ethical challenges that demand careful consideration and robust governance frameworks (European Commission 2025). The ethical landscape surrounding GenAI in research extends beyond traditional research integrity concerns. Whilst foundational principles such as accountability, and transparency remain central, the unique characteristics of generative AI systems—including their probabilistic nature, potential for hallucination, and capacity for sophisticated content generation—necessitate new ethical frameworks specifically tailored to these technologies (Farangi et al. 2024). The stakes are particularly high in research contexts, where the integrity of knowledge production and the credibility of scientific institutions depend upon maintaining rigorous ethical standards. Recent scholarship has highlighted the multifaceted nature of these ethical considerations. Hagendorff's comprehensive scoping review identified 378 distinct normative issues across 19 topic areas, demonstrating the breadth and complexity of challenges that researchers, institutions, and policymakers must navigate (Hagendorff 2024). These challenges encompass technical considerations related to system reliability and bias, as well as fundamental questions about human agency, intellectual property, authorship attribution, and the preservation of critical thinking skills in an increasingly automated research environment. The European Union has emerged as a global leader in developing comprehensive frameworks for responsible AI governance, with particular attention to research applications. This leadership builds upon a robust foundation of research integrity principles established through the ALLEA (All European Academies) European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, revised in 2023 (2023). The ALLEA code serves as the primary standard for upholding research integrity across all EU-funded research projects and explicitly underpins the living guidelines for promoting the responsible use of generative AI in research. The ALLEA code establishes four fundamental principles of research integrity: reliability in ensuring research quality, honesty in developing and communicating research transparently, respect for colleagues and society, and accountability for research from conception to publication (ALLEA 2023). These principles provide the ethical foundation upon which AI-specific guidelines are built, recognising that whilst technology evolves, core research integrity values remain constant. Building upon this foundation, the European Commission's Living Guidelines on the Responsible Use of Generative AI in Research, updated in April 2025, represents the most current and comprehensive attempt to provide practical guidance for the research community (European Commission 2025). These guidelines also draw upon the foundational principles established in the EU's Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, which articulated seven key requirements for ethical AI deployment: human agency and oversight, technical robustness and safety, privacy and data governance, transparency, diversity and non-discrimination, societal and environmental well-being, and accountability (European Commission 2019). The EU framework adopts a stakeholder-specific approach, providing tailored recommendations for researchers, research organisations, and research funding bodies. For individual researchers, the guidelines emphasise the importance of developing AI literacy whilst maintaining critical evaluation skills. Researchers are encouraged to understand the limitations and potential biases of AI systems, maintain transparency about AI assistance in their work, and ensure that human judgement remains central to research decision-making processes.Research organisations are called upon to establish institutional policies and support structures that facilitate responsible AI use whilst maintaining research integrity. This includes developing training programmes, establishing ethical review processes for AI-assisted research, and creating infrastructure that supports secure and compliant AI deployment (European Commission 2025). Complementing EU policy initiatives, leading academic institutions have developed their own frameworks for ethical GenAI use. Porsdam Mann et al. exemplify the academic community's commitment to establishing philosophically grounded ethical guidelines for AI-assisted research (Porsdam Mann et al. 2024). This framework proposes three essential criteria for the ethical use of large language models in academic writing: human vetting and guaranteeing (where at least one author must guarantee and take responsibility for accuracy and integrity), substantial human contribution (each author must provide substantial contribution to conception, analysis, or drafting), and acknowledgement and transparency (authors should acknowledge LLM use appropriately) (Porsdam Mann et al. 2024). These criteria address fundamental concerns about maintaining human responsibility and academic integrity whilst enabling beneficial use of AI assistance in scholarly work. Several fundamental principles emerge consistently across these various frameworks. The principle of human agency requires that researchers maintain meaningful control over research design, methodology selection, and interpretation of findings, even when utilising AI assistance. This extends beyond mere oversight to encompass genuine understanding of AI contributions and the ability to critically evaluate and validate AI-generated outputs.Transparency represents another cornerstone, encompassing both technical transparency about AI system functioning and procedural transparency about AI use in research processes. Researchers must be able to explain how AI systems contribute to their work and how AI-generated outputs are integrated into research findings (European Commission 2025). This requirement poses particular challenges given the ""black box"" nature of many contemporary AI systems.Accountability principles establish clear lines of responsibility for research outcomes whilst recognising the complex interactions between human researchers and AI systems. Human researchers retain ultimate responsibility for the quality, accuracy, and ethical implications of their work, regardless of the level of AI assistance employed (European Commission 2019). This responsibility cannot be delegated to AI systems or their developers.Privacy and data governance considerations are particularly crucial given the sensitive nature of much research data. Researchers must ensure that privacy protections are maintained throughout the entire data lifecycle when using AI systems, whilst carefully evaluating the provenance of AI training data and considering potential data leakage risks (ALLEA 2023). These ethical frameworks provide the foundation for addressing specific practical challenges that researchers face when implementing GenAI in their work. The principles outlined above directly inform approaches to three critical areas that require detailed consideration: authorship attribution and responsibility for AI-generated content, ensuring transparency in research applications through publisher requirements and guidelines, and developing appropriate citation practices for various generative AI tools whilst maintaining process documentation and prompting transparency. Each of these areas presents unique challenges that build upon the foundational ethical principles whilst requiring specific guidance and best practices. The question of authorship attribution, for instance, must balance recognition of AI contributions with preservation of human responsibility and creativity. Transparency requirements must address both technical disclosure about AI use and procedural documentation that enables reproducibility and peer review. Citation practices must evolve to accommodate new forms of AI assistance whilst maintaining scholarly integrity and enabling proper attribution.  References: 1.

Where Does Bias Come From? Exploring Dataset Imbalance, Annotation Bias, and Pre-existing Modelling Choices;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 30, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/where-does-bias-come-from-exploring-dataset-imbalance-annotation-bias-and-pre-existing-modelling-choices/;politics;No sources found;"Bias in artificial intelligence systems has become a critical concern as these technologies increasingly influence decision-making across domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, and employment. Bias manifests as systematic errors that lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, often disproportionately affecting marginalised groups. Understanding the origins of bias is essential for developing effective strategies to identify and mitigate it. Dataset imbalance occurs when the data used to train AI models does not adequately represent the diversity of the target population or phenomenon. This imbalance can lead to models that perform poorly for underrepresented groups or reinforce existing inequalities. For instance, facial recognition systems trained on datasets with a predominance of light-skinned individuals have historically shown lower accuracy for darker-skinned faces (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018). Such disparities arise because machine learning algorithms optimise for the majority class, often neglecting minority groups. The roots of dataset imbalance lie in both practical and systemic factors. Collecting diverse data can be challenging due to logistical constraints, such as limited access to certain populations or regions. However, systemic issues, such as the historical exclusion of marginalised groups from data collection, exacerbate the problem (West et al. 2019). For example, medical datasets often underrepresent women and ethnic minorities, leading to biased diagnostic models that fail to account for their unique health profiles (Obermeyer et al. 2019). Mitigating dataset imbalance requires proactive strategies, such as oversampling underrepresented groups, generating synthetic data, or using transfer learning to adapt models to diverse contexts (Barocas et al. 2023). Validation techniques, such as stratified sampling and fairness-aware metrics like demographic parity, can help assess whether models perform equitably across groups. These approaches, however, must be complemented by efforts to address the structural factors that perpetuate imbalanced data collection. Annotation bias arises during the process of labelling data, where human annotators introduce subjective or erroneous judgements that skew the training data. Since many AI systems rely on supervised learning, the quality and impartiality of annotations directly influence model performance. Annotation bias can stem from annotators’ cultural, social, or personal biases, as well as from ambiguous labelling guidelines or inadequate training (Geiger et al. 2020). A notable example is in natural language processing (NLP), where sentiment analysis models trained on biased annotations may misinterpret expressions from certain cultural or linguistic groups. For instance, annotations that label African American Vernacular English as “negative” or “informal” can lead to models that unfairly penalise these dialects (Sap et al. 2019). Similarly, in image recognition, annotators may inadvertently prioritise certain visual features, such as gender or race, over others, embedding stereotypes into the model (Crawford and Paglen 2021). Managing annotation bias requires robust annotation protocols, including clear guidelines, diverse annotator pools, and inter-annotator agreement checks. Techniques such as active learning, where models iteratively query annotators to refine ambiguous labels, can also reduce bias (Settles 2011). Validation methods, such as auditing annotations for consistency and fairness, are critical to ensuring that labelled data accurately reflects the intended task. Engaging communities affected by the AI system in the annotation process can further enhance fairness and accountability (West et al. 2019). Pre-existing modelling choices refer to the assumptions, algorithms, and architectures selected during the design and training of AI systems. These choices, often made before data is even processed, can introduce bias by embedding developers’ implicit assumptions or prioritising certain outcomes over others. For example, the choice of a loss function in a classification model may prioritise overall accuracy at the expense of fairness for minority groups (Hardt et al. 2016). One common source of bias in modelling choices is the reliance on proxy variables that inadvertently capture protected attributes, such as race or gender. For instance, architectural decisions, such as the use of deep neural networks with high complexity, can amplify biases in imbalanced datasets by overfitting to majority patterns (Barocas et al. 2023). Addressing bias from modelling choices requires careful consideration of algorithmic design and evaluation. Fairness-aware algorithms, such as those that enforce equal opportunity or disparate impact constraints, can mitigate biased outcomes (Hardt et al. 2016). Additionally, model interpretability techniques, such as feature importance analysis, can help identify and address problematic assumptions. Validation strategies, including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, are essential for assessing how modelling choices affect performance across diverse groups. Identifying bias in AI systems is a multifaceted challenge that requires both technical and ethical considerations. Validation plays a central role in this process, enabling developers to assess whether models produce equitable outcomes. Common validation techniques include fairness metrics, such as equalised odds and calibration, which measure disparities in model performance across groups (Barocas et al. 2023). Adversarial testing, where models are evaluated on intentionally perturbed or diverse inputs, can also uncover hidden biases (Geiger et al. 2020). Managing bias, however, extends beyond technical fixes. It demands a commitment to ethical AI development, including transparency, stakeholder engagement, and continuous monitoring. Post-deployment audits, where models are evaluated in real-world settings, can detect biases that emerge over time (Obermeyer et al. 2019). Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists, ethicists, and affected communities is essential for designing systems that align with societal values (Crawford and Paglen 2021).

Core Prompt Types by Complexity Levels: General, Specific, and Chain of Thought prompts;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;May 24, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/core-prompt-types-by-complexity-levels-general-specific-and-chain-of-thought-prompts/;political, policy;No sources found;"Prompts are central to human-AI interaction, with their complexity directly influencing the performance of large language models (LLMs). Within prompt engineering, prompts can be categorised by their structural and functional complexity. This section focuses on three core prompt types: short, general questions or instructions; longer, specific questions with defined output requirements; and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. Short, general prompts are concise and open-ended, such as “What are the main drivers of social inequality?” or “Summarise theories of political participation.” These prompts allow AI flexibility in generating responses, making them suitable for exploratory research. Brown et al. (2020) highlight their utility in probing broad conceptual knowledge, though their ambiguity can lead to inconsistent or overly general outputs. Wei et al. (Wei et al. 2022) argue that general prompts struggle to capture precise intent, limiting their use in rigorous academic contexts. Nevertheless, they are valuable for exploratory research, such as brainstorming or hypothesis generation, where broad overviews initiate deeper investigation. Longer, specific prompts incorporate detailed instructions and explicit constraints, such as ""Provide a 1,000-word literature review on machine learning applications in bioinformatics, citing at least five peer-reviewed sources from the last three years, formatted in APA style."" These prompts reduce ambiguity, guiding AI towards precise, research-ready outputs. Liu et al. (Liu et al. 2023) demonstrate that specific prompts enhance LLM performance on tasks demanding factual accuracy and adherence to academic standards. Such prompts align outputs with scholarly needs, producing results suitable for journal submissions or policy reports, as shown in studies on prompt specificity (Reynolds & McDonell 2021). For example, “Analyse the impact of social media on political polarisation in the EU, including statistical evidence and three case studies” yields structured analyses. Crafting these prompts requires familiarity with research conventions, and overly rigid instructions may limit novel insights (Kaplan & Haenlein 2020). They are essential for tasks like policy evaluation or ethnographic reviews, where precision is paramount. Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, introduced by Kojima et al. (Kojima et al. 2022), prompts AI to articulate reasoning step-by-step, as in “Evaluate the validity of rational choice theory in explaining voter turnout, detailing each assumption and supporting evidence.” CoT excels in complex analytical tasks, enhancing reasoning transparency, which is crucial for fields like political economy or social network analysis. Its structured approach supports novel applications, such as evaluating theoretical models or interpreting qualitative data (Wang et al. 2022;Wang et al. 2024). Recent advancements show that reasoning can be further improved by techniques like representation engineering, where control vectors modulate LLM activations to enhance performance on reasoning tasks (Højer et al. 2025). For example, “Analyse survey data on public trust in institutions, explaining each statistical step” aids rigorous data interpretation. CoT requires carefully designed prompts, which can be time-intensive, and its computational demands may limit real-time use (Zhao et al. 2025). In sum, short, general prompts prioritise accessibility and creativity, specific prompts ensure precision, and CoT prompting excels in complex reasoning. Each type serves distinct roles in prompt engineering, with effectiveness tied to task demands and user expertise. Understanding these core complexity levels is essential for optimising human-AI collaboration.  References: 1. Brown, Tom, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D. Kaplan,

Data Protection and Generative AI: Safeguarding Research Data and Personal Information in AI Systems;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jun 17, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/data-protection-and-generative-ai-safeguarding-research-data-and-personal-information-in-ai-systems/;policy, governance;No sources found;"Research data, by its very nature, often contains sensitive information that requires careful protection. Whether dealing with personal health records, proprietary research findings, confidential survey responses, or commercially sensitive datasets, researchers must navigate the tension between leveraging the analytical power of GenAI systems and maintaining appropriate levels of data protection. The stakes are particularly high in fields such as medical research, social sciences, and commercial research and development, where data breaches can have far-reaching consequences for individual privacy, institutional reputation, and competitive advantage. The protection of personal information within GenAI systems presents additional layers of complexity, as these systems may inadvertently memorise and subsequently reproduce sensitive personal details from their training data (Carlini et al. 2021). The phenomenon of data memorisation in large language models has been extensively documented, with researchers demonstrating that models can reproduce verbatim text from their training datasets, potentially exposing personal information, confidential communications, and proprietary content. The implications of such capabilities extend beyond immediate privacy concerns to encompass broader questions of consent, data ownership, and the ethical use of personal information in AI development. The architecture and operational characteristics of generative AI systems create multiple pathways through which research data and personal information may be exposed or compromised. Understanding these risks requires examination of the various stages of AI system development and deployment, from initial data collection and model training through to inference and output generation. Each stage presents distinct vulnerabilities that researchers must consider when evaluating the appropriateness of GenAI tools for their specific use cases. The training phase of generative AI models represents perhaps the most significant area of risk for data exposure. During this phase, models are exposed to vast datasets that may contain sensitive research data or personal information, either intentionally included for training purposes or inadvertently captured through web scraping and data aggregation processes. The scale of modern AI training datasets, which can encompass billions of documents and data points, makes it virtually impossible to manually review all content for sensitive information. Consequently, proprietary research findings, personal communications, confidential documents, and other sensitive materials may become embedded within the model's learned representations. The phenomenon of membership inference attacks represents a particularly concerning vulnerability in GenAI systems. These attacks enable malicious actors to determine whether specific data points were included in a model's training dataset, potentially revealing sensitive information about individuals or research subjects. Liu et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive analysis of membership inference techniques, demonstrating how attackers can exploit model outputs to infer the presence of specific data in training sets. The implications for research data protection are significant, as successful membership inference attacks could reveal participation in sensitive studies, exposure to particular treatments, or inclusion in confidential datasets. Model inversion attacks present another significant threat to data protection in GenAI systems. These sophisticated attacks attempt to reconstruct training data from model parameters or outputs, potentially enabling the recovery of sensitive information that was used during the training process (Shokri et al. 2017). The success of such attacks varies depending on the model architecture, training methodology, and the nature of the target data, but the potential for sensitive information recovery remains a persistent concern for researchers utilising GenAI technologies. The deployment and inference phases of GenAI systems introduce additional risks related to data sharing and exposure. When researchers input sensitive data into AI systems for analysis or content generation, they may inadvertently share this information with third-party service providers, potentially exposing confidential research data to unauthorised access or misuse (Brazilian Data Protection Authority 2024). The Irish Data Protection Commission's guidance emphasises that organisations using AI products supplied by third parties face additional security and data protection risks, particularly when personal data is input by staff members into AI tools without full understanding of how such data is protected or processed (Data Protection Commission Ireland 2024). The terms of service and data handling practices of commercial AI platforms vary significantly, and researchers may not fully understand how their input data is processed, stored, or potentially used for further model training. The Hamburg Data Protection Authority's analysis provides crucial insights into the technical architecture of AI systems, distinguishing between the storage of large language models and the processing activities that occur when personal data is input into AI-supported systems (Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information 2024). The Authority clarifies that whilst the mere storage of an LLM does not constitute processing within the meaning of Article 4(2) GDPR, as no personal data is stored in LLMs themselves, the processing of personal data within LLM-supported AI systems must comply with GDPR requirements, particularly regarding the output of such systems. This distinction is critical for understanding where data protection obligations arise in complex AI architectures. Data leakage through model outputs represents a more immediate and observable risk in GenAI systems. These systems may inadvertently reproduce sensitive information from their training data in response to user queries, effectively creating a pathway for unauthorised access to confidential information (Ye et al. 2024). The Chinese perspective on GenAI governance, as examined by Ye et al. (2024), highlights the particular challenges posed by data leakage in systems trained on diverse, multilingual datasets that may contain varying levels of sensitive content across different jurisdictions and cultural contexts. The global nature of many GenAI platforms introduces additional complexities related to data sovereignty and cross-border data transfers. Research data that is processed by AI systems hosted in different jurisdictions may be subject to varying legal frameworks and protection standards, potentially creating gaps in data protection coverage. The implications are particularly significant for researchers working with data subject to specific regulatory requirements or institutional policies regarding data localisation and cross-border transfers. The development of effective risk management strategies for data protection in GenAI systems requires comprehensive approaches addressing technical, organisational, and procedural aspects whilst maintaining AI utility for legitimate research purposes. The complexity and evolving nature of GenAI technologies necessitate adaptive frameworks that respond to emerging threats. Technical safeguards form the foundation of effective data protection in GenAI systems. Privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacy, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption offer promising approaches for protecting sensitive information whilst enabling AI model training and deployment (Zewe 2025). These technologies enable researchers to leverage GenAI analytical capabilities whilst minimising sensitive information exposure risks. Data minimisation strategies play a crucial role by limiting personal information collection and processing to research necessities, requiring careful balance between analytical needs and privacy protection requirements. Anonymisation and pseudonymisation techniques provide additional protection layers, though modern AI systems' sophisticated capabilities challenge traditional approaches through pattern recognition and data correlation techniques (Drenik 2025). Organisational measures represent critical components of comprehensive data protection strategies. The establishment of clear governance frameworks, data handling protocols, and accountability mechanisms ensures privacy considerations are integrated throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner 2024). These include institutional policies regarding AI use, ethics review processes, and training programmes ensuring researchers understand GenAI privacy implications. Access controls and authentication mechanisms provide essential safeguards through robust access management systems ensuring only authorised personnel access sensitive data and AI capabilities, supported by audit trails and monitoring systems. Data governance frameworks specifically designed for AI applications offer structured approaches managing privacy risks across data collection, model training, deployment, and maintenance phases. Transparency and explainability measures contribute to effective privacy protection by enabling researchers to understand how GenAI systems process and utilise their data. The development of interpretability tools and documentation standards helps researchers make informed decisions about AI application appropriateness whilst facilitating early risk identification. Regular auditing and assessment procedures provide essential mechanisms for monitoring privacy protection effectiveness and identifying emerging risks. The dynamic nature of AI technologies requires ongoing evaluation of privacy safeguards through technical security evaluations, organisational policy reviews, and emerging threat analysis.

Fine-tuning: Adapting General Models for Specific Tasks and Applications;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Feb 12, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/fine-tuning-adapting-general-models-for-specific-tasks-and-applications/;policy;No sources found;"The evolution of machine learning has led to the development of powerful general models, such as BERT, GPT-3, and Vision Transformers (ViT), which have transformed artificial intelligence applications across diverse domains. These models, pre-trained on extensive datasets like Common Crawl for natural language processing or ImageNet for computer vision, demonstrate exceptional generalisation capabilities but often require task-specific adaptation to achieve optimal performance. Fine-tuning, the process of refining a pre-trained model to enhance its effectiveness for a particular task or application, is a pivotal technique in this adaptation. This essay explores the principles, methodologies, and challenges of fine-tuning, drawing on foundational and contemporary literature to highlight its role in machine learning. By examining theoretical foundations, practical approaches, and ethical considerations, this discussion aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of fine-tuning’s significance in aligning general models with specialised applications. Fine-tuning leverages the concept of transfer learning, where knowledge acquired from a broad, general task is transferred to a more specific one. As described by Bengio (2012), transfer learning enables models to exploit features learned from large, diverse datasets, reducing training time and data requirements for specialised tasks. General models, often trained on datasets like ImageNet for computer vision or Common Crawl for natural language processing, capture universal patterns that serve as a robust starting point for fine-tuning. The process typically involves taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This approach is grounded in the idea that lower-level features (e.g., edges in images or syntactic structures in text) are broadly applicable, while higher-level features require adjustment to align with the target task (Yosinski et al. 2014). Fine-tuning adjusts the model’s parameters, either across all layers or selectively, to optimise performance on the new task while retaining the general knowledge encoded in the pre-trained weights. Fine-tuning encompasses a range of strategies, each tailored to the model architecture, task requirements, and available resources. The most common approach is full fine-tuning, where all model parameters are updated during training on the target dataset. This method is effective when the target task is significantly different from the original task but requires substantial computational resources and a sufficiently large dataset to avoid overfitting (Devlin et al. 2019). An alternative is partial fine-tuning, where only specific layers—typically the higher layers—are updated, while lower layers remain frozen. This technique, often referred to as feature-based transfer, is computationally efficient and suitable for tasks closely related to the pre-training task. For instance, in natural language processing, fine-tuning the final layers of BERT for sentiment analysis preserves the model’s general linguistic knowledge while adapting it to the classification task (Devlin et al. 2019). Recent advancements have introduced parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as adapters and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). Adapters insert small, trainable modules into the model, allowing task-specific adjustments without modifying the original weights (Houlsby et al. 2019). LoRA, on the other hand, fine-tunes low-rank approximations of weight updates, significantly reducing memory and computational costs (Hu et al. 2022). These methods are particularly valuable for deploying large models in resource-constrained environments or for tasks with limited labelled data. Beyond technical challenges, fine-tuning raises critical ethical and practical considerations. Biases embedded in pre-training data can persist or be amplified during fine-tuning, leading to unfair outcomes in sensitive applications such as healthcare or criminal justice. For instance, a language model fine-tuned for recruitment may perpetuate gender or racial biases if the target dataset reflects historical inequities, underscoring the need for robust bias mitigation strategies (Blodgett et al. 2020). Mitigating these risks requires rigorous dataset auditing and the application of debiasing techniques during both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Practically, fine-tuning large models like GPT-3 or BERT demands significant computational resources, raising concerns about environmental sustainability and accessibility. The energy-intensive nature of fine-tuning contributes to substantial carbon emissions, necessitating more sustainable approaches (Strubell et al. 2019). Parameter-efficient methods like LoRA offer promising solutions by reducing resource demands, yet their adoption remains limited in certain domains (Hu et al. 2022). Additionally, reliance on proprietary models and datasets can restrict access for smaller organisations, highlighting the importance of open-source initiatives to democratise AI development. Fine-tuning represents a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling the adaptation of powerful general models to a wide array of specific tasks and applications. By building on the principles of transfer learning, fine-tuning leverages pre-trained knowledge to achieve high performance with reduced data and computational requirements. However, challenges such as catastrophic interference, domain shift, and overfitting necessitate careful methodological choices and robust mitigation strategies. Ethical considerations, including bias and environmental impact, further underscore the need for responsible fine-tuning practices. As parameter-efficient techniques and open-source ecosystems continue to evolve, fine-tuning is poised to become even more accessible and sustainable, driving innovation across diverse fields. Future research should focus on developing adaptive fine-tuning methods that balance performance, efficiency, and fairness, ensuring that the benefits of general models are fully realised in specialised contexts.

Prompt Components: Instructions, Context, Format, and Examples;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;May 9, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/prompt-components-instructions-context-format-and-examples/;strategy;No sources found;"The most fundamental component of any prompt is the instruction, which explicitly defines the task the model is expected to perform. A simple query might pose a question, but a well-crafted instruction provides a clear, actionable directive. This distinction is crucial; an instruction such as, “Summarise the following academic article into five bullet points, focusing on the methodology and results,” is significantly more effective than the ambiguous question, “What is this article about?” The former specifies the task (summarise), the output structure (five bullet points), and the focus (methodology and results), thereby constraining the model’s vast potential response space to align with the user's specific goal. Advanced instructional techniques, such as assigning a persona (e.g., “You are an expert economist; analyse this market report”), further refine the model’s output by priming it to adopt a specific tone, style, and knowledge base. While instructions direct the model’s actions, context provides the necessary grounding for those actions. Context refers to any information, data, or background knowledge supplied within the prompt that the model requires to complete the task accurately. This can range from a block of text to be translated, a set of data points to be analysed, or the history of a preceding conversation. Providing explicit context is a primary strategy for mitigating the risk of hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information (Ji et al. 2023). By furnishing the model with the relevant source material directly within the prompt, the user anchors the generation process in a given reality, reducing the model's reliance on its internal, parametric knowledge which can be outdated or incorrect. As prompt complexity grows, the need for clear contextual boundaries becomes paramount, ensuring the model operates on the information provided rather than making unverified assumptions. The third critical component, format, governs the structural organisation of both the input prompt and the desired output. For input, a well-structured prompt uses clear delimiters—such as triple hashes (###), XML tags, or markdown headings—to logically separate instructions from context, and context from examples. This structural clarity helps the model to parse the user's intent correctly, preventing different parts of the prompt from being conflated. Equally important is the specification of the output format. By instructing the model to respond in a particular structure, such as JSON, a numbered list, or a table, the user ensures the output is not only relevant but also programmatically usable and easily digestible (Lin 2024). This level of control over the output syntax is essential for integrating LLMs into automated workflows and applications, where consistency and predictability are non-negotiable. Perhaps the most powerful component for guiding nuanced model behaviour is the inclusion of examples, a technique known as in-context learning. First popularised by Brown et al. (2020) in their work on GPT-3, in-context learning allows a model to infer the desired pattern, style, or reasoning process from demonstrations provided directly within the prompt. This gives rise to a spectrum of prompting strategies. A ‘zero-shot’ prompt contains only an instruction, relying entirely on the model’s pre-trained abilities. A ‘one-shot’ prompt includes a single example, while a ‘few-shot’ prompt provides multiple examples to demonstrate the task more robustly (Wei et al. 2022). By showing, rather than just telling, users can guide the model on complex tasks that are difficult to describe through instructions alone. A sophisticated extension of this is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which involves providing examples that include the intermediate reasoning steps required to reach a final answer. This has been shown to significantly improve performance on tasks requiring logical deduction or multi-step problem-solving (Wei et al. 2022). In conclusion, the construction of an effective prompt is a multi-faceted process of communication design, not merely a matter of posing a question. The four key components—instructions, context, format, and examples—each play a distinct and vital role. Instructions provide the directive, context provides the grounding, format provides the structure, and examples provide the template for nuanced execution. The mastery and synthesis of these components enable a user to move from simple interactions to sophisticated task delegation, significantly enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and utility of large language models. As research in this area continues to advance (Liu et al. 2023), a deep understanding of these foundational building blocks will remain the cornerstone of effective human-AI collaboration.

Authorship Attribution and Responsibility for AI-Generated Content: Can Generative AI Tools Be Authors?;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jun 12, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/authorship-attribution-and-responsibility-for-ai-generated-content-can-generative-ai-tools-be-authors/;governance;No sources found;"The proliferation of various generative AI tools raises profound questions about authorship in scientific publications, particularly whether GenAI systems can be considered authors and how responsibility for their output should be shared. Traditional notions of authorship emphasise human agency, accountability, and intellectual contribution, as outlined in established guidelines from bodies like the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which require authors to make substantial contributions, draft or revise work critically, approve the final version, and agree to be accountable for all aspects (ICMJE 2024). GenAI, however, operates through probabilistic pattern-matching rather than genuine understanding or ethical judgement, challenging these criteria. This section examines the attribution of authorship to GenAI, the allocation of responsibility for AI-generated content, prevailing journal policies on the matter, and illustrative cases where misuse has led to significant problems. GenAI tools cannot be considered authors under current scholarly frameworks, primarily because they lack the capacity for accountability and intentionality. Authorship traditionally implies a moral and legal responsibility that machines cannot fulfil, as they do not possess consciousness or the ability to defend their work. For instance, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) asserts that AI tools fail to meet authorship requirements since they cannot assume responsibility for submitted content, including accuracy, integrity, or potential conflicts of interest (COPE Council 2024). Foundational literature on authorship, such as that from Kassirer, reinforces this by emphasizing that each listed author must be able to take public responsibility for its content, a standard predating AI but directly applicable today (Kassirer 1995). In practical terms, GenAI systems like GPT-4 generate outputs based on training data, often producing plausible but inaccurate information—a phenomenon known as 'hallucination'—without the ability to verify or correct it. Consequently, attributing authorship to such tools would undermine the credibility of academic discourse, as authorship serves not only to credit but also to ensure traceability and ethical oversight. Journal policies consistently prohibit GenAI tools from being listed as authors, emphasising that only natural persons qualify for such attribution. A survey of leading publishers reveals a consensus on this point, as summarised in the table below: Responsibility for AI-generated content invariably rests with human authors, who must oversee, verify, and disclose its use to maintain research integrity. Authors bear the onus of ensuring that GenAI outputs align with factual accuracy and ethical standards, including avoiding plagiarism or bias amplification from training datasets. Policies from major publishers stipulate that AI cannot be named as an author and that its application must be transparently reported, with humans accountable for any errors. This aligns with broader ethical considerations in AI ethics, where human oversight mitigates risks like misinformation. For example, if GenAI assists in drafting sections of a manuscript, authors must critically review and integrate it, treating the tool as an aid rather than a collaborator. Failure to do so can lead to breaches of integrity, as GenAI may inadvertently replicate copyrighted material or fabricate references, placing the burden on humans to rectify such issues. Despite these safeguards, numerous cases illustrate the perils of mishandling GenAI in academic work, often resulting in retractions, ethical violations, and reputational damage. One notable incident involves a preprint where ChatGPT was credited as a co-author in a study on metaverse applications in education, prompting widespread disapproval from scientists who argued that AI lacks the accountability required for authorship. In another case, a paper in Nurse Education in Practice listed ChatGPT as an author, leading to debates on integrity and eventual scrutiny (Stokel-Walker 2023). A fraudulent scheme uncovered in the Global International Journal of Innovative Research involved AI-generated articles misattributed to non-existent authors, demonstrating risks of identity theft and evidence manipulation (Spinellis 2025). Google Scholar has been inundated with GPT-fabricated papers on controversial topics, spreading misinformation and evading detection until flagged (Haider et al. 2024). These examples, drawn from recent retractions exceeding 10,000 annually, underscore the exponential rise in AI-fueled misconduct, including hallucinatory references and plagiarised content (Van Noorden 2023). In sum, the integration of GenAI into scholarly workflows offers undeniable benefits but demands rigorous governance to preserve trust. By denying authorship to AI tools and enforcing human responsibility, publishers and institutions mitigate risks while fostering innovation. As technologies evolve, ongoing revisions to guidelines, informed by cases of misuse, will be essential to balance progress with integrity. Ultimately, authorship remains a distinctly human endeavour, rooted in ethical accountability that machines cannot replicate.  References: 1.

Detecting, Evaluating, and Reducing Hallucinations;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 15, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/detecting-evaluating-and-reducing-hallucinations/;framework;No sources found;"Detecting hallucinations involves distinguishing accurate outputs from those that deviate from factual or contextual grounding. One approach is consistency checking, where LLM outputs are evaluated against external knowledge bases to identify discrepancies. Manakul et al. (2023) propose SelfCheckGPT, a zero-resource method that uses the model’s internal consistency to detect hallucinations by sampling multiple outputs and measuring their divergence, supporting real-time detection in applications like chatbots. Another technique involves uncertainty estimation, where LLMs assess their own confidence to flag potential hallucinations. Hu et al. (2024) introduce the Pinocchio benchmark, which tests the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs, enabling the identification of hallucinated content by comparing outputs to verified facts in domains like history or science. Human-in-the-loop evaluation remains essential for detecting nuanced hallucinations, especially in subjective contexts. Bender and Koller (2020) highlight that human evaluators can assess contextual appropriateness, identifying errors that automated systems might overlook. However, this method’s resource-intensive nature limits its scalability. Automated metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, have been adapted to measure factual consistency by comparing outputs to reference texts (Lewis et al. 2020). More recently, the FACTSCORE metric evaluates the proportion of verifiable factual claims in generated text, offering a targeted tool for hallucination detection (Min et al. 2023). Evaluating hallucinations involves assessing their severity and impact to prioritise mitigation efforts. Hallucinations vary from minor factual errors to misleading claims with significant consequences. Ji et al. (2023) propose a taxonomy for categorising hallucinations based on their source, such as training data biases, and their impact, such as ethical concerns. This framework helps focus mitigation on high-impact errors. Quantitative evaluation often uses benchmark datasets like TruthfulQA, which probes LLMs’ tendencies to generate false answers (Lin et al. 2022). Performance on such datasets provides a measurable indicator of hallucination rates, facilitating comparisons across models. Qualitative evaluation complements quantitative methods by assessing contextual appropriateness. Tam et al. (Tam et al. 2023) advocate evaluating factual consistency in news summarisation, analysing whether hallucinations disrupt the coherence and accuracy of generated summaries. This approach ensures that evaluations capture the practical implications of hallucinations, such as undermining user trust in generated content, particularly in applications like summarisation or storytelling. Reducing hallucinations in LLMs requires a comprehensive approach that integrates advancements in model architecture, training methodologies, and post-processing techniques. Curating high-quality, diverse training datasets is fundamental, as noisy or biased data can propagate errors during training. Brown et al. (2020) emphasise data filtering to remove contradictory or low-quality information, enhancing model reliability through de-duplication and fact-checking during preprocessing. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) further mitigates hallucinations by grounding outputs in verified external knowledge. By accessing real-time data from knowledge bases during inference, RAG ensures factual accuracy, particularly in question-answering tasks (Lewis et al. 2020). Fine-tuning LLMs on fact-checked datasets aligns outputs with ground truth, with Min et al. (2023)demonstrating significant reductions in hallucination rates in high-stakes domains like medicine through human-annotated data. Prompt engineering also plays a critical role, with techniques like chain-of-thought prompting encouraging LLMs to reason explicitly, thereby reducing unsupported claims in complex tasks (Wei et al. 2023). Early work on retrieval-augmented models, such as REALM, laid the groundwork for integrating external knowledge into language models, improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks (Guu et al. 2020). Combining these strategies—data curation, RAG, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and knowledge integration—creates a robust framework for minimising hallucinations, ensuring LLMs produce trustworthy and accurate content across diverse applications.

Exploring GDPR, EU AI Act, Compliance Requirements, and Security Protocols for Sensitive Research Data;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jun 22, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/exploring-gdpr-eu-ai-act-compliance-requirements-and-security-protocols-for-sensitive-research-data/;policy, regulation, framework, governance;No sources found;"In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as a foundational instrument, mandating stringent controls on personal data processing within AI systems (Novelli et al. 2024). Complementary legislation, such as the EU AI Act, introduces risk-based classifications to ensure ethical deployment (European Data Protection Board 2024). In the United Kingdom, adaptations post-Brexit, including the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025, align with these principles while promoting innovation. These regulations are crucial for handling sensitive research data, which often includes personal health or proprietary information vulnerable to breaches. Compliance requires integrating legal obligations with robust security measures to mitigate risks like data leakage and bias amplification (Taeihagh 2025). The GDPR, effective since 2018, establishes core principles for processing personal data, including lawfulness, transparency, and accountability, which extend to generative AI contexts (Ruschemeier 2025). It categorises personal data expansively, requiring controllers to justify processing activities, particularly in AI training where vast datasets may inadvertently include sensitive information (Solove 2025). The regulation prohibits automated decision-making with significant effects unless safeguards are in place, a provision increasingly relevant to generative models that could perpetuate biases. Building on the GDPR, the EU AI Act, adopted in 2024, employs a tiered risk framework, designating certain generative AI systems as high-risk and mandating conformity assessments (Novelli et al. 2024). Providers must ensure transparency in training data and outputs, aligning with GDPR's data minimisation principle to prevent over-collection. The Act's phased implementation, with full enforcement by 2026, includes prohibitions on unacceptable risks, such as manipulative AI, and emphasises human oversight (European Data Protection Board 2024). This integration addresses gaps in traditional data protection by focusing on AI-specific harms. In the UK, the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 modifies the UK GDPR to facilitate data sharing for research while upholding protections (Taeihagh 2025). It introduces provisions for automated processing in low-risk scenarios and emphasises data sovereignty in cross-border transfers. Globally, these frameworks influence standards, with bodies like the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) advocating harmonised guidelines on AI data scraping (CNIL 2025). Such regulations underscore the evolving need for adaptive governance to balance innovation with rights preservation. Achieving compliance in generative AI necessitates identifying a lawful basis for data processing under the GDPR, such as consent or legitimate interests, with the latter requiring a rigorous balancing test against individual rights (Ruschemeier 2025). For sensitive research data, explicit consent is often mandated, coupled with transparent notices detailing AI usage (Solove 2025). Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) are compulsory for high-risk activities, evaluating potential harms like privacy intrusions in model training. The EU AI Act amplifies these by requiring fundamental rights impact assessments for high-risk systems, ensuring non-discrimination and proportionality (Novelli et al. 2024). Transparency mandates compel labelling of AI-generated content to avert misinformation, while accountability involves documenting data provenance and conducting audits (European Data Protection Board 2024). In the UK, the 2025 Act permits broader automated decisions with human intervention safeguards, but retains DPIA requirements for sensitive data. Organisations must address cross-border complexities, employing mechanisms like standard contractual clauses for transfers (Taeihagh 2025). Ongoing staff training and incident reporting protocols enhance compliance, as emphasised by regulatory guidance (CNIL 2025). These requirements foster a proactive stance, integrating ethical considerations throughout the AI lifecycle. Securing sensitive research data in generative AI demands multifaceted protocols, beginning with encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorised exposure (Achuthan et al. 2024). Techniques like differential privacy add noise to datasets, preserving utility while anonymising personal information during training (Ruschemeier 2025). Federated learning enables model development across decentralised sources without centralising data, reducing breach risks. Provenance tracking logs data origins and transformations, ensuring traceability and compliance with GDPR's accuracy principle (Taeihagh 2025). Intrusion detection systems, powered by AI, monitor for anomalies, while regular vulnerability assessments align with standards like ISO 27001 (Achuthan et al. 2024). For cloud-hosted AI, vendor due diligence verifies adherence to security benchmarks, including multi-factor authentication. These protocols must evolve with threats, incorporating red teaming to simulate attacks and mitigate jailbreaking vulnerabilities (Novelli et al. 2024). Ultimately, they safeguard research integrity, preventing data poisoning or leakage that could undermine scientific validity.  References: 1.

Cost Optimisation Strategies: Token Usage Optimisation, Batch Processing, and Prompt Compression Algorithms;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 3, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/cost-optimisation-strategies-token-usage-optimisation-batch-processing-and-prompt-compression-algorithms/;framework;No sources found;"Contemporary researchers face unprecedented financial barriers when engaging with state-of-the-art language models, particularly through API-based services where costs are directly proportional to token consumption and computational resource utilisation. The challenge is compounded by increasing complexity of research tasks requiring extensive prompt engineering, iterative model interactions, and large-scale data processing operations. Consequently, cost optimisation strategies have become essential for maintaining research productivity whilst operating within financial constraints. Recent advances in computational efficiency have provided researchers with sophisticated tools for reducing operational costs without compromising research quality. These developments encompass three primary domains: token usage optimisation through systematic conversation management, batch processing methodologies for efficient resource utilisation, and prompt compression algorithms that maintain semantic integrity whilst reducing computational overhead. Prompt compression algorithms represent one of the most significant advances in cost optimisation for AI research. Jiang et al. (2023) introduced LLMLingua, a coarse-to-fine prompt compression method demonstrating up to 20x compression ratios with minimal performance degradation. The approach incorporates a budget controller to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios, coupled with a token-level iterative compression algorithm designed to model interdependence between compressed contents. Building upon these foundational advances, Pan et al. (2024) introduced LLMLingua-2, which addresses critical limitations through a data distillation procedure that derives knowledge from large language models without losing crucial information. The approach reformulates prompt compression as a token classification problem, utilising a Transformer encoder architecture to capture essential information from full bidirectional context. This enables the use of smaller, more efficient models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT, resulting in 3x-6x performance improvements over existing prompt compression methods. The practical implications for research cost optimisation are substantial. LLMLingua-2 achieves end-to-end latency acceleration of 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios ranging from 2x-5x, directly translating to proportional cost reductions for researchers utilising API-based language models. The task-agnostic nature ensures robust generalisability across different research domains and LLM architectures, reducing the need for domain-specific optimisation and associated development costs (Pan et al. 2024). Token usage optimisation addresses the direct relationship between token consumption and financial expenditure in API-served language models. Garcia Alarcia and Golkar (2024) introduced a novel approach through Design Structure Matrix (DSM) methodologies from the engineering design discipline. The approach addresses fundamental challenges associated with short context windows, limited output sizes, and costs associated with token intake and generation. The DSM methodology provides a systematic framework for organising conversations to minimise tokens sent to or retrieved from language models whilst optimising context window utilisation. The technical implementation involves clustering and sequencing analysis tools that enable systematic conversation organisation, demonstrated effectively in complex research scenarios such as spacecraft design conversations (Garcia Alarcia & Golkar 2024). The methodology enables researchers to group related conversation chunks that can be allocated to different context windows, thereby optimising token utilisation across multiple interaction sessions. Token optimisation strategies also encompass format-specific approaches. Research has demonstrated that utilising CSV format over JSON can result in significant token reduction due to fewer repetitive characters (Slingerland 2024). Similarly, ensuring JSON responses are lean through elimination of unnecessary whitespaces and line breaks contributes to meaningful cost reductions, particularly for researchers conducting large-scale data collection operations. Batch processing methodologies enable researchers to achieve dramatic improvements in cost efficiency through strategic workload organisation and parallel processing architectures. Traditional monolithic processing systems often underutilise computational resources and result in suboptimal cost-performance ratios. Contemporary batch processing approaches address these limitations through sophisticated parallelisation strategies and dynamic resource allocation mechanisms. Barrak and Ksontini (Barrak and Ksontini 2025) demonstrated the transformative potential of serverless parallel processing architectures for machine learning inference tasks, achieving execution time reductions exceeding 95% compared to monolithic approaches whilst maintaining cost parity. The research employed sentiment analysis using the DistilBERT model and IMDb dataset, providing concrete evidence of practical benefits achievable through strategic batch processing implementation. The technical architecture involves decomposing monolithic processes into parallel functions that can be executed simultaneously across distributed computational resources. This enables researchers to leverage inherent parallelism in many research tasks, particularly those involving large-scale data processing, model inference, or iterative computational operations. The serverless paradigm provides automatic scaling capabilities that ensure optimal resource utilisation whilst eliminating overhead associated with manual resource management. Batch processing methodologies also enable sophisticated cost management strategies through temporal load balancing and resource scheduling. By strategically timing batch operations to coincide with periods of lower computational demand or reduced pricing, researchers can achieve additional cost savings whilst maintaining research productivity (Saini & Reddy 2024). The convergence of prompt compression algorithms, token usage optimisation, and batch processing methodologies creates opportunities for synergistic cost reduction strategies that exceed benefits achievable through individual implementation. Researchers can develop comprehensive cost optimisation frameworks that leverage complementary strengths of each methodology whilst addressing their respective limitations. Practical implementation begins with systematic assessment of research workflows to identify opportunities for each optimisation approach (Saini & Reddy 2024). Prompt compression algorithms are particularly effective for research involving extensive prompt engineering or complex reasoning tasks. Token usage optimisation through DSM methodologies proves most beneficial for researchers conducting iterative conversations with language models. Batch processing approaches offer maximum benefits for researchers conducting large-scale data processing operations or computational experiments that can be parallelised. Effective cost optimisation requires continuous monitoring and adjustment based on evolving research requirements and technological developments. The rapid pace of advancement in language model architectures, API pricing structures, and computational efficiency techniques necessitates regular reassessment of optimisation approaches to ensure continued effectiveness. The implementation of sophisticated cost optimisation strategies represents a critical capability for contemporary AI researchers seeking to maintain research productivity whilst operating within financial constraints. Through the strategic integration of prompt compression algorithms (achieving 2x-20x compression ratios whilst maintaining semantic integrity), token usage optimisation via Design Structure Matrix methodologies for systematic conversation management, and batch processing approaches that demonstrate 95% execution time reductions whilst maintaining cost parity, researchers can achieve synergistic benefits that exceed the sum of individual implementations. These comprehensive cost optimisation frameworks enable substantial reductions in computational expenses whilst maintaining or improving research productivity and output quality, proving particularly critical for ensuring equitable access to advanced AI research capabilities across diverse institutional and individual research contexts, thereby addressing the escalating costs associated with lengthy prompts, complex reasoning tasks, and large-scale computational operations in the contemporary AI research landscape.

Why Size Matters: The Impact of Model Scale on Performance and Capabilities in Large Language Models;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Mar 16, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/why-size-matters-the-impact-of-model-scale-on-performance-and-capabilities-in-large-language-models/;policy;No sources found;"A defining characteristic of LLMs is their scale, measured by the number of parameters, which has grown exponentially in recent years. Models such as GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, and its successors have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, raising questions about the relationship between model size and performance (Brown et al. 2020). This essay explores why size matters in LLMs, examining how scaling impacts performance, capabilities, and limitations, while drawing on foundational and contemporary scholarly sources. The scaling hypothesis posits that increasing the size of a neural network, alongside sufficient data and computational resources, leads to improved performance across a range of tasks. Kaplan et al. (2020) formalised this idea, demonstrating through empirical studies that larger models exhibit predictable improvements in perplexity—a measure of how well a model predicts a sequence of words. Their work established scaling laws, showing that performance scales as a power-law function of model size, dataset size, and compute. For instance, doubling the number of parameters in a transformer-based model can yield significant reductions in perplexity, translating to better language understanding and generation. This hypothesis has been validated by models like GPT-3, which outperforms its smaller predecessors, such as GPT-2 (Radford et al. 2019), in tasks ranging from text completion to question answering. The increased parameter count allows larger models to capture more complex patterns in data, enabling them to generalise better across diverse linguistic contexts. However, scaling is not without trade-offs. As models grow, the computational cost of training and inference rises exponentially, raising concerns about energy consumption and accessibility (Strubell et al. 2019). Beyond raw performance metrics, scaling enhances the emergent capabilities of LLMs—abilities that smaller models struggle to exhibit. Brown et al. (2020) highlight that GPT-3 demonstrates few-shot learning, where the model can perform tasks with minimal examples provided in the prompt. This capability emerges only at larger scales, as smaller models lack the capacity to generalise from sparse data. For example, GPT-3 can translate languages, write code, or solve simple mathematical problems with few or no task-specific training examples, a feat unattainable by earlier, smaller models like BERT (Devlin et al. 2019). Moreover, larger models exhibit improved contextual understanding, allowing them to maintain coherence over longer text sequences. This is particularly evident in tasks like story generation or dialogue, where maintaining narrative consistency is critical. Wei et al. (Wei et al. 2022) argue that scale enables ""emergent abilities,"" such as reasoning and commonsense understanding, which are not explicitly programmed but arise from the model’s ability to encode vast amounts of world knowledge. However, these capabilities are not universal; performance on specialised tasks, such as medical or legal reasoning, may still require fine-tuning or domain-specific data (Bommasani et al. 2022). While scaling yields impressive gains, it also introduces significant challenges. One major limitation is the diminishing returns of scaling. Kaplan et al. (2020) note that beyond a certain point, increasing model size yields smaller improvements in performance relative to the computational cost. This raises questions about the sustainability of pursuing ever-larger models, particularly as the environmental impact of training LLMs becomes a pressing concern. Strubell et al. (2019) estimate that training a single large model can emit as much carbon as a transatlantic flight, prompting calls for more efficient architectures or training methods. Another challenge is the amplification of biases. Larger models, trained on vast datasets scraped from the internet, often encode societal biases present in their training data. Bender et al. (2021) argue that scaling exacerbates these issues, as larger models are more likely to reproduce harmful stereotypes or generate toxic content. Mitigating these biases requires careful dataset curation and post-training interventions, which are resource-intensive and not always effective. Furthermore, larger models are less accessible to researchers and organisations with limited computational resources. The democratisation of AI research is hindered when only well-funded entities can afford to train or deploy state-of-the-art models (Bommasani et al. 2022). This creates an uneven playing field, limiting innovation and diversity in NLP applications. The success of scaling can be traced to foundational theories in machine learning. Rumelhart et al. (1986) introduced the concept of distributed representations, where knowledge is encoded across a network’s parameters. Larger models leverage this principle by distributing linguistic and world knowledge across billions of parameters, enabling richer representations. Additionally, the universal approximation theorem (Cybenko, 1989) suggests that sufficiently large neural networks can approximate any function, providing a theoretical basis for why scaling improves model expressiveness. However, these theoretical insights do not fully explain emergent behaviours in LLMs. Wei et al. (2022) suggest that scale induces qualitative shifts in model behaviour, potentially due to phase transitions in learning dynamics. These phenomena are not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying scaling. Given the challenges of scaling, researchers are exploring alternatives to simply increasing model size. Techniques such as model pruning, quantisation, and knowledge distillation aim to create smaller, more efficient models without sacrificing performance (Bommasani et al. 2022). Additionally, modular architectures, where smaller specialised models collaborate on complex tasks, offer a promising avenue for balancing capability and efficiency. Another direction is improving data quality over quantity. Smaller models trained on carefully curated, high-quality datasets can sometimes outperform larger models trained on noisy data (Bender et al. 2021). This approach aligns with efforts to address biases and reduce the environmental footprint of NLP research.  References: 1.

Generative AI and the Evolving Challenge of Deepfake Detection;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 26, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/generative-ai-and-the-evolving-challenge-of-deepfake-detection/;political, regulation;No sources found;"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised digital media through its ability to synthesise highly realistic content, with deepfake technology standing as one of its most prominent and contentious applications. The term “deepfake,” derived from “deep learning” and “fake,” refers to synthetic media—typically videos or audio—that convincingly depict individuals performing actions or saying words they never did (Westerlund 2019). While the underlying technologies, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), were initially developed for research and creative applications, the concept of deepfakes quickly became associated with misuse, particularly in online environments. As generative AI algorithms have advanced, deepfakes have evolved into tools for misinformation, fraud, and privacy violations (Alanazi et al. 2024). This discussion examines the technical foundations of deepfakes, their societal implications, and the ongoing efforts to detect and mitigate their risks, drawing on both foundational and contemporary scholarship. Deepfakes rely on advanced deep learning architectures, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders. GANs, introduced by Goodfellow et al. (Goodfellow et al. 2014), consist of two neural networks—a generator that produces synthetic content and a discriminator that assesses its authenticity—trained in opposition to create highly realistic outputs. Autoencoders compress input data (e.g., facial images) into a latent space, enabling manipulation and reconstruction of altered features, such as face swapping (Katarya & Lal 2020). Recent advancements incorporate variational autoencoders (VAEs), transformers, and diffusion models, enhancing visual fidelity and temporal consistency in synthetic media (Kaur et al. 2024). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enhance deepfake quality by capturing spatial and temporal patterns, ensuring realistic outputs (Mirsky & Lee 2021). These technological strides, while innovative, have lowered the barrier to creating deepfakes, with some models requiring minimal source material, such as a single image or short audio clip, to generate credible synthetic content (Alanazi et al. 2024). The societal impact of deepfakes is profound, with applications ranging from constructive to malicious. In entertainment, deepfakes enable digital resurrections of historical figures or virtual casting, while in education, they facilitate immersive historical reenactments (Alanazi et al. 2024). However, their misuse poses significant risks. Deepfakes can fabricate political speeches or inflammatory statements, manipulating public opinion and threatening electoral integrity (Al-Khazraji et al. 2023). Non-consensual deepfake pornography, which disproportionately targets women, inflicts reputational and psychological harm, with studies indicating that most such content is produced without consent (Veljković et al. 2024). The erosion of trust in media is another critical concern. By presenting fabricated content as authentic, deepfakes undermine the reliability of visual and auditory evidence, challenging judicial processes and journalistic standards (Maras & Alexandrou 2019). This phenomenon, described as an “infocalypse,” threatens epistemic justice and public confidence in institutions (Kerner & Risse 2021). Additionally, deepfakes facilitate cybercrimes such as identity theft and fraud, exploiting their ease of production and distribution (Veljković et al. 2024). Detecting deepfakes is increasingly difficult due to their growing sophistication. Early detection methods relied on identifying visual artefacts, such as irregular blinking or unnatural facial movements (Li et al. 2018). However, modern deepfakes exhibit fewer such flaws, rendering traditional approaches less effective. The adversarial nature of GANs exacerbates this challenge, as creators can train models to evade detection, creating an ongoing “arms race” between generation and detection. Generalisation remains a significant hurdle. Detection models trained on specific deepfake types (e.g., face swaps) often fail to identify others, such as voice cloning or full-body manipulations (Kaur et al. 2024). Furthermore, real-time detection demands significant computational resources, limiting scalability for platforms processing large volumes of user-generated content (Mirsky & Lee 2021). Recent detection strategies leverage AI to counter synthetic media. CNN-based models analyse spatial inconsistencies, such as pixel-level distortions or lighting anomalies, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks detect temporal irregularities in video frames (Kaur et al. 2024). Forensic techniques, such as spectrogram analysis for audio deepfakes, identify anomalies in synthetic speech, while advanced methods like capsule networks enhance robustness across diverse scenarios (Mirsky & Lee 2021). Blockchain-based watermarking and digital signatures authenticate media at creation, preventing unauthorised manipulation (Hasan & Salah 2019). Human-AI collaboration, where algorithms flag suspicious content for human review, balances automation with accuracy (Al-Khazraji et al. 2023). These interdisciplinary approaches address both technical and societal dimensions of the deepfake challenge. The future of deepfake detection hinges on adaptive, scalable solutions. Transfer learning and few-shot learning could enable detection models to generalise across diverse deepfake types with minimal retraining (Kaur et al. 2024). Regulatory frameworks are also critical. While some jurisdictions have criminalised malicious deepfake creation, balancing free speech with regulation remains complex (Tan et al. 2023). As synthetic media becomes harder to distinguish from reality, fostering critical media literacy will be just as important as technical safeguards. Public education on media literacy is essential to empower individuals to critically evaluate digital content and reduce reliance on automated detection (Al-Khazraji et al. 2023). Ethically, detection efforts must prioritise fairness and privacy. Biased algorithms risk disproportionately flagging certain demographics, while excessive content monitoring threatens free expression (Kerner & Risse 2021). Collaborative initiatives among academia, industry, and policymakers can foster ethical guidelines that promote innovation while mitigating harm.  References: 1.

The Third Draft of the EU General-Purpose AI Code of Practice: Concerns and Constitutional Debates;poltextLAB AI journalist;Apr 25, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-third-draft-of-the-eu-general-purpose-ai-code-of-practice-concerns-and-constitutional-debates/;political, policy;Title: When Guidance Becomes Overreach, Author: Verfassungsblog, URL: https://verfassungsblog.de/when-guidance-becomes-overreach-gpai-codeofpractice-aiact/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: EU AI Act: Latest draft Code for AI model makers tiptoes towards gentler guidance for Big AI | TechCrunch, Author: TechCrunch, URL: https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/eu-ai-act-latest-draft-code-for-ai-model-makers-tiptoes-towards-gentler-guidance-for-big-ai/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Industry flags ‘serious concerns’ with EU AI code of practice, Author: Euronews, URL: https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/03/12/industry-flags-serious-concerns-with-latest-draft-of-eu-ai-code-of-practice?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com;On 11 March 2025, the third draft of the EU General-Purpose AI (GPAI) Code of Practice was published, raising significant concerns among industry stakeholders and legal experts. Designed for providers of GPAI models like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Midjourney, the Code aims to assist businesses in complying with the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), which will take full effect in 2027. However, the draft exceeds the AI Act’s obligations, introducing requirements such as mandatory external evaluations and additional copyright provisions, sparking constitutional questions about the European Commission’s implementing powers. The Code’s drafting process has also drawn heavy criticism, involving nearly 1,000 stakeholders but lacking transparent rules and democratic safeguards. Professor Martin Ebers, President of the Robotics & AI Law Society, argues that the process fails to meet the procedural requirements of European law, and the draft oversteps the content obligations set by the AI Act. Several provisions are contentious, such as point II.11, which mandates external evaluations before market release for GPAI models posing systemic risks. At the same time, the AI Act (Article 55(1)(a)) only requires adversarial testing of model evaluations. On copyright, measure I.2.4 requires GPAI developers to make reasonable efforts to determine whether protected content was collected by robots.txt-compatible crawlers—a requirement not stipulated by the AI Act. Industry reactions to the draft, open for written feedback until 30 March before finalisation in May, have been mixed. Boniface de Champris, Senior Policy Manager at CCIA, stated that serious issues remain, including far-reaching obligations on copyright and transparency that threaten trade secrets. Iacob Gammeltoft, Senior Policy Manager at News Media Europe, was more critical: copyright imposes a results-based obligation requiring lawful access, and it’s simply not enough to ask AI developers for ‘best efforts’ to avoid using our content without permission. The Commission must carefully review the draft before approval, as its current form risks undermining the political compromise carefully balanced by the AI Act and exceeding the Commission’s implementing powers in a potentially unconstitutional manner.

Carr accused the DSA of restricting free speech, asserting that the European approach represents excessive regulation and is incompatible with American values. He referenced a directive from President Donald Trump on 21 February, which urges action against what he described as overseas coercion of U.S. tech companies by Europe. The FCC Chairman argued that the DSA could usher in a new form of censorship and described the operating environment for significant tech companies in Europe as concerning. ""The potential censorship arising from the DSA is incompatible with both the American tradition of free speech and the commitments these technology companies have made to diversity of opinion,"" Carr stated at the conference. He also revealed that he had engaged with U.S. tech companies subject to the DSA to develop a strategy to help them avoid hefty fines while upholding American free speech principles. The Trump administration has clarified that it will intervene on behalf of U.S. companies if Europe imposes protectionist regulations on them. Domestically, the FCC Chairman has launched a significant deregulation programme, including a ""Delete, Delete, Delete"" initiative to abolish as many regulations as possible. On 20 March 2025, the FCC introduced four significant changes, including a provision clarifying that telecommunications companies can decommission copper networks without performance tests, provided they cite ""the totality of circumstances"" during an appropriate substitution test. According to Harold Feld, Vice President of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, this change, combined with eliminating most remaining notification requirements, means ""there’s no need to worry about evidence. Just say ‘the totality of circumstances,’ and by the time anyone who cares figures it out, the request will already be approved."" Additionally, at the request of the USTelecom lobby, the FCC permitted service providers to no longer offer standalone voice services, requiring them to bundle them with broadband internet, even though such bundles are more expensive for consumers who only want telephone services.

The plan focuses on five key areas, including developing a large-scale AI computing infrastructure, increasing access to high-quality data, and promoting AI adoption in strategic sectors, while addressing tech companies’ criticisms that EU regulations are overly burdensome for innovation. As part of the Action Plan, the EU will establish at least 13 AI factories across Europe, leveraging the existing supercomputing network, and create up to 5 AI gigafactories, each equipped with approximately 100,000 state-of-the-art AI chips—four times the capacity of current AI factories. According to the European Commission, these AI gigafactories will integrate vast computational power and data centres to train and develop complex AI models at an unprecedented scale, which plans to mobilise €20 billion through the InvestAI initiative to stimulate private investment in gigafactories. Additionally, the Commission proposes a Cloud and AI Development Act to at least triple the EU’s data centre capacity over the next five to seven years. The Commission will also establish the AI Act Service Desk, serving as a central point of contact to support businesses complying with the AI Act. The Commission will soon launch the Apply AI Strategy to boost the current 13.5% AI adoption rate among EU enterprises, encouraging industrial AI use and widespread adoption in the EU’s strategic public and private sectors. To meet the growing demand for AI talent, the Commission will facilitate the international recruitment of highly skilled AI experts and researchers through initiatives like the Talent Pool and the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action ‘MSCA Choose Europe’, while offering AI fellowship programmes via the forthcoming AI Skills Academy. Furthermore, it will develop education and training programmes in AI and generative AI for key sectors, preparing future AI professionals and supporting workforce upskilling. Sources: 1. 2. 3.

The EU investigation launched in 2023 found that X broke the law by failing to provide adequate transparency about advertisers, denying external researchers access to disinformation data, and failing to properly verify ""verified"" accounts, making the platform more vulnerable to abuse and foreign interference. EU authorities are conducting two parallel investigations against X: the first focusing on the specific violations mentioned above, and a second, more comprehensive investigation alleging that X's lax content moderation practices have made the platform a hub for illegal hate speech, disinformation, and other content undermining democracy across the EU's 27 member states. Under the DSA, companies can be fined up to 6 percent of their global revenue, and since X is solely owned by Musk, the EU is considering including revenue from Musk's other private companies, such as SpaceX, in the fine calculation, potentially raising the possible penalty well above $1 billion. We have always enforced and will continue to enforce our laws fairly and without discrimination toward all companies operating in the EU, in full compliance with global rules, stated a European Commission spokesperson. The X case emerges at a particularly sensitive time amid escalating trans-Atlantic trade tensions following Donald Trump's announcement of new tariffs, and with Musk serving as a close advisor to President Trump. X has already responded to the expected penalty, calling it an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech, while Musk previously stated he was ready to defend his platform in a very public battle in court. The announcement of sanctions against X is expected in summer 2025, though the EU and X could still reach a settlement if the company implements changes that satisfy regulators' concerns. The decision could have far-reaching implications as it will be the first major attempt to enforce the DSA, which requires tech companies to better police their platforms and provide adequate transparency about how their services work.

According to a February 2025 analysis by the European Parliament Research Service, this issue is particularly pronounced in the case of high-risk AI systems, where one regulation explicitly encourages, while the other strictly limits, the processing of protected personal data (such as ethnic origin, religion, and health information). The root of the issue is highlighted in the European Parliament Research Service’s February 2025 analysis, which notes that, to prevent discrimination, Article 10(5) of the AI Act permits the processing of special category data when strictly necessary for monitoring, detecting, and correcting biases in high-risk AI systems. A concrete example is that employers would need to know applicants’ ethnic origins to assess discrimination in algorithms used in the employment sector, as supported by Van Bekkum and Borgesius’s study: to evaluate whether an AI system disadvantages job applicants based on certain ethnic origins, the relevant organisation must have access to the applicants’ ethnic data. The March 2025 report by legal experts Doklestic Repic & Gajin also observes that this creates a situation where compliance with one framework risks violating the other. The AI Act explicitly states that it does not affect the application of the GDPR, yet the precise legal relationship between the two regulations remains unclear. The European Parliament Research Service acknowledges a shared uncertainty about how to interpret the AI Act’s provision on processing special category data to prevent discrimination, and notes that the GDPR, which restricts the processing of such data, may prove restrictive in an environment where AI dominates numerous economic sectors. The solution will likely require amendments to the GDPR, the AI Act, or both. Sources: 1. 2. 3.

This regulation transforms the use of health data across the EU, establishing the world’s first common health data space. It ensures that citizens have full control over their own health data while enabling the secure secondary use of data for research, innovation, and policymaking purposes. The EHDS Regulation is built on two main pillars: primary data use, which enables EU citizens to access their electronic health data free of charge and immediately, and secondary data use, which allows anonymised health data to be utilised for research, innovation, and policymaking purposes. The regulation entered into force on 26 March 2025, but its practical implementation will occur gradually over the coming years: by 26 March 2027, numerous implementing legal acts must be adopted; from 26 March 2029, the exchange of the first data group (patient summaries, e-prescriptions/e-dispensations) will begin across all EU Member States, and the rules on secondary data use will take effect for most data categories; and from 26 March 2031, the exchange of the second data group (medical images, laboratory results, and hospital discharge reports) will become operational across all Member States, alongside the application of secondary use rules to remaining data categories (e.g., genomic data). The regulation marks a historic milestone in the EU’s digital health strategy, enabling 450 million EU citizens to directly access their electronic health data and share it across borders in all 27 Member States. According to information published on the European Commission’s website, the full implementation of the EHDS will bring significant benefits: over the next decade, it could generate total savings of approximately €11 billion by improving data accessibility, while also enhancing the efficiency of healthcare services and supporting the growth of the digital health sector, ultimately delivering better health outcomes for EU citizens.

The multi-year, three-phase engineering project covers Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and most Azure services, now storing even technical support data within the EU. Microsoft invested over $20 billion in AI and cloud infrastructure across Europe in the past 16 months for the project. In a joint blog post, Julie Brill, Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President and Chief Privacy Officer, and Paul Lorimer, Corporate Vice President for Microsoft 365, emphasised that the initiative reflects Microsoft’s commitment to delivering unmatched cloud services that support European transparency, protect privacy, and enhance customer control. However, experts like Frank Karlitschek, CEO of Nextcloud, warned that the U.S. Cloud Act grants U.S. authorities access to cloud data held by American companies, regardless of whether it is stored in the U.S., Europe, or elsewhere. Analysts note that European companies face a new dilemma: can they rely on an American cloud provider, even one with an EU data boundary? Mark Boost, CEO of Civo, stated that Microsoft is the latest major cloud provider to announce a significant data residency system with great publicity—without guaranteeing sovereignty. Dr. Alberto P. Marti, Vice President of Open Innovation at OpenNebula Systems, added that U.S. companies, including Microsoft, risk having U.S. government decisions heavily impact European digital infrastructure, noting growing awareness in Europe of the need for greater technological autonomy.

The planned amendments aim to enhance the competitiveness of European businesses while preserving the GDPR’s core data protection principles. The Commission initially scheduled the presentation of the simplification package for 16 April, but this has been postponed to 21 May, with the official proposal expected by June at the latest. Since its introduction in 2018, the GDPR has faced significant criticism for its complexity, particularly from smaller businesses. Danish Digital Minister Caroline Stage Olsen stated that while the GDPR contains many positive aspects and data protection is essential, the regulation should not be overly rigid. Compliance must be made easier for businesses and companies. Justice Commissioner Michael McGrath, commenting on the GDPR review conducted in the summer of 2024, noted that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) particularly need greater support in their compliance efforts. The simplification may address requirements for maintaining records of data processing activities and reforming data protection impact assessments, which are especially burdensome for smaller firms. Dr. Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of ImmuniWeb, argued that the GDPR, in its current form, causes more harm and obstacles than tangible benefits. The GDPR review is expected to be accompanied by intense lobbying, as seen during its initial drafting when over 3,000 amendments were submitted in the European Parliament.

AI agents are software applications designed to perceive and interact with the virtual environment, operate autonomously, but their work is set by ""specific predefined rules"" – as formulated in the Commission's package on virtual worlds published March 31. These tools go beyond traditional chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, capable of tackling several tasks autonomously, such as joining online meetings, taking notes, or even reciting certain information on behalf of users, while leading AI companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and French firm Mistral, are all experimenting with their own AI agent applications. According to a 2025 report from global AI experts, they may pose security risks as users are unaware of what their AI agents are doing, they can operate outside of the user's control, and AI-to-AI interactions can occur. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, and a fifth of online store interactions and at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be conducted by agents. Anthropic added a Computer Use feature to its Claude Sonnet chatbot in October 2024, giving it the ability to navigate desktop apps, move cursors, click buttons, and type text, while OpenAI announced Operator in January, an agentic tool that runs in-browser to autonomously perform actions such as ordering groceries or booking tours.

These facilities will be powered by up to 100,000 advanced AI processors and target significant innovations in healthcare, biotech, industry, robotics, and scientific discovery. The EU is attempting to catch up with the US and China, as a Stanford University report showed American institutions produced 40 notable AI models in 2024, compared to China's 15 and Europe's mere 3 (all French). The EU has already launched a plan to build 13 AI factories - sites with supercomputers and datacentres where researchers develop and test AI models - but the new gigafactories would be much larger, costing €3-5 billion each compared to €600 million for the biggest AI factory. According to the strategy document, these power-hungry facilities, which may require huge amounts of water for cooling, would run ""as much as possible"" on green energy, with the EU generating 47% of electricity from renewable sources in 2024, though John Hyland, a Greenpeace spokesperson, warned: Every power-guzzling datacentre risks being a lifeline to polluting power plants, well illustrated in Ireland where they consume over a fifth of the electricity.

This poses a significant challenge to Europe’s Mistral AI, which has secured over €1 billion in investment and reached a valuation of €5.8 billion. Mistral AI, initially focused on developing high-performance models, may now be forced to rethink its strategy. According to Antoine Moyroud, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, the company is already adapting to the changing landscape: It’s clear that Mistral had to embed engineering and product development into its DNA, evolving from a purely research-driven company into one that now spans all three domains. The French startup has made significant inroads into the enterprise sector, securing contracts with major corporations such as BNP Paribas, Axa, and the French Ministry of Defence. According to Callum Stewart, an analyst at GP Bullhound, the emergence of DeepSeek could benefit Mistral as it may encourage the company to develop more cost-effective models for budget-conscious enterprises. Mistral has already responded to the challenge and is announcing a new model this week. The company stated that the model complements large open-source inference models, such as DeepSeek’s recent releases, and is a strong foundational model for building inference capabilities.

As a result of the investigation, Microsoft submitted a comprehensive set of commitments, with the most significant element being the creation of a database containing at least 10 billion Hungarian words. The ""pre-cooked"" (cleaned, deduplicated, formatted) dataset will not only be integrated into the company's AI systems but also made available to other developers.

Microsoft's commitment also extends to organising educational programs for Hungarian civil servants, SMEs, and consumers to better understand the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence. László Palkovics, government commissioner for artificial intelligence, emphasised to Index: The development of Hungarian-language artificial intelligence systems is not just a technological challenge but a national interest. University professor Zoltán Szűts described the decision as a cultural milestone, stating that to preserve the Hungarian language and cultural heritage, we need artificial intelligence that speaks and thinks in Hungarian.

Fundamental Principles of Machine Learning and Its Place in the AI Ecosystem;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 10, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/fundamental-principles-of-machine-learning-and-its-place-in-the-ai-ecosystem/;framework;No sources found;"Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms that enable systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions. Mitchell (1997, 2) provides a foundational definition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” This framework encapsulates ML’s core principles: task definition, performance evaluation, and experiential learning. ML algorithms are broadly categorised into three paradigms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training models on labelled datasets to predict outcomes, as seen in applications like image classification (e.g.,Krizhevsky et al. 2012). Unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabelled data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction (e.g.,Hinton & Salakhutdinov 2006). Reinforcement learning, inspired by behavioural psychology, trains agents to optimise rewards through trial and error, exemplified by AlphaGo’s success (Silver et al. 2016). At the algorithmic level, ML relies on mathematical foundations, including linear algebra, probability theory, and optimisation. For instance, gradient descent underpins many ML models by iteratively minimising error in parameter estimation (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, have revolutionised ML by enabling hierarchical feature learning, significantly advancing fields like natural language processing and computer vision (LeCun et al. 2015). However, ML’s reliance on data raises challenges. Overfitting, where models memorise training data rather than generalising, and bias in datasets, which can perpetuate societal inequalities, are persistent issues (Dwork et al. 2012). Furthermore, the “black box” nature of complex models, such as deep neural networks, complicates interpretability, prompting research into explainable AI (Gunning 2017). The AI ecosystem comprises multiple subfields, including ML, expert systems, robotics, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and knowledge representation. ML’s prominence stems from its versatility and empirical success, but it does not operate in isolation. Its integration with other AI paradigms enhances system capabilities, while its limitations highlight the need for complementary approaches. In NLP, ML underpins models like transformers, enabling advancements in language generation and translation (Vaswani et al. 2017). However, symbolic AI, which relies on predefined rules and knowledge bases, remains relevant for tasks requiring explicit reasoning, such as legal expert systems (Bench-Capon 1993). Similarly, in robotics, ML facilitates perception and motion planning, but control theory and planning algorithms are critical for precise execution (Siciliano et al. 2008). ML’s data-driven approach marks a departure from earlier rule-based systems, which faced challenges in scalability and adaptability. The transition to ML, fuelled by enhanced computational power and vast data availability, has been a key driver of AI’s recent achievements. However, ML’s focus on narrow tasks raises concerns about its limitations in achieving general intelligence. Emerging hybrid approaches that combine ML with symbolic reasoning aim to address these shortcomings, fostering more robust and adaptable systems. The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) further underscores the need to integrate ML with other paradigms, such as cognitive architectures, to develop intelligence that mirrors human versatility (Boden 2016). Machine learning thus stands not merely as a central pillar of the AI ecosystem, but as a dynamically evolving field that continuously reshapes the possibilities and boundaries of artificial intelligence. Whilst current ML paradigms have achieved remarkable successes in pattern recognition and prediction, future AI systems will likely be founded upon hybrid approaches that combine the empirical strength of machine learning with the explicit reasoning capabilities of symbolic AI and other complementary methods. The field's continued development requires not only the resolution of technical challenges—such as interpretability, bias mitigation, and improved generalisation—but also careful consideration of ethical and societal questions, particularly on the path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Ultimately, machine learning is not an end in itself, but rather a tool for solving human problems and extending our capabilities, whose proper application will be decisive in determining AI's future role in society.

Main Types of Generative Models and Their Operating Principles: GANs, Diffusion Models, and Autoregressive Models;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Feb 28, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/main-types-of-generative-models-and-their-operating-principles-gans-diffusion-models-and-autoregressive-models/;framework;No sources found;"Generative models represent a fundamental paradigm in machine learning, enabling computers to create new data samples that closely mirror real-world examples. These models have become indispensable tools across diverse fields including image creation, natural language processing, and scientific research. Three principal architectures have emerged as dominant approaches: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and autoregressive models (Bond-Taylor et al. 2021). Each methodology employs distinct theoretical foundations and operational mechanisms, offering unique advantages for different applications whilst presenting specific challenges and limitations. Generative Adversarial Networks, introduced by Goodfellow et al. in 2014, revolutionised generative modelling through their innovative adversarial training paradigm (Goodfellow et al. 2014). The fundamental principle involves a competitive relationship between two neural networks: a generator that produces synthetic data samples from random noise, and a discriminator that attempts to distinguish between real and generated samples. This relationship resembles a counterfeiter trying to create fake currency whilst a detective attempts to identify forgeries. The counterfeiter continuously improves based on feedback from the detective, whilst the detective becomes increasingly skilled at spotting fakes. This adversarial process drives both networks to improve iteratively, with the generator learning to produce increasingly realistic synthetic data. GANs have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation, achieving photorealistic results across diverse domains. Notable applications include StyleGAN for high-quality face generation, which can create remarkably realistic human faces that are indistinguishable from photographs (Karras et al. 2019). For researchers, GANs have proven particularly valuable in medical imaging applications, where synthetic data can help expand small datasets for training diagnostic models, addressing privacy concerns whilst maintaining statistical validity. However, adversarial training presents inherent challenges including mode collapse, where the generator produces limited variety in outputs, and training instability that can lead to convergence difficulties (Arjovsky et al. 2017). These limitations motivated the development of improved variants such as Wasserstein GANs, which provide more stable training by adjusting how the networks learn and measure differences between real and synthetic data distributions (Gulrajani et al. 2017). Recent improvements have also included Progressive GANs and other architectural innovations that enhance both stability and output quality. Diffusion models represent a paradigm shift in generative modelling, drawing inspiration from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and physical processes observed in nature. The foundational theoretical framework was first outlined by Sohl-Dickstein et al. in 2015, establishing the mathematical basis for this approach (Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015). Subsequently, Ho et al. advanced the field significantly with their work on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), demonstrating that these models could achieve image quality comparable to or exceeding that of GANs (Ho et al. 2020). The core principle involves a two-stage process analogous to gradually adding noise to a clear image until it becomes pure static, then learning to reverse this process. In the forward diffusion stage, the model systematically adds Gaussian noise to training images across multiple timesteps until the original image is completely obscured. The reverse denoising stage involves training a neural network to learn how to remove this noise step by step, effectively reconstructing coherent images from pure noise. During generation, the model starts with random noise and applies the learned denoising process iteratively, gradually refining the noise into a coherent image. This progressive refinement approach often produces higher quality results compared to single-step generation methods, as each denoising step allows for careful adjustment and improvement of the emerging image. Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in image synthesis, often surpassing GANs in terms of sample quality and diversity (Dhariwal & Nichol 2021). Notable implementations include DALL-E 2 for text-to-image generation, Stable Diffusion for high-quality image synthesis, and various applications in audio creation. For researchers, diffusion models are particularly appealing due to their strong theoretical foundation and versatility across multiple modalities including images, audio, and even molecular structures. The primary limitation of diffusion models lies in their computational intensity, as the iterative generation process requires many steps and can be significantly slower than single-step alternatives. However, recent advances such as latent diffusion models have addressed this challenge by working with compressed representations of data, substantially reducing computational requirements whilst maintaining output quality (Rombach et al. 2022). Autoregressive models constitute a fundamental class that creates data sequentially, where each new element is generated based on all previously created elements. These models decompose the joint probability distribution of data into a product of conditional probabilities, enabling tractable likelihood computation and straightforward sampling procedures. The underlying principle resembles writing a story word by word, where each new word is chosen based on all preceding words. The model learns patterns and relationships in sequences, enabling prediction of what should come next given particular context. This sequential generation allows for variable-length outputs and natural incorporation of context and dependencies. The transformer architecture has become the dominant framework for implementing autoregressive models, particularly in natural language processing (Vaswani et al. 2017). The key innovation lies in their attention mechanism, which allows models to focus on relevant parts of input sequences when generating each new element, enabling sophisticated understanding of long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. The GPT family exemplifies the power of autoregressive approaches in natural language processing. Beginning with Radford et al.'s original work, these models demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning diverse linguistic patterns through unsupervised training on large text corpora (Radford et al. 2019). Subsequent iterations have shown that scaling model parameters and training data leads to emergent capabilities in few-shot learning, reasoning, and task generalisation. Autoregressive models extend beyond text generation to other domains. In image generation, models like PixelRNN and PixelCNN apply the same sequential principle to pixels, building images one pixel at a time (Van Den Oord et al. 2016). These approaches demonstrate the versatility of autoregressive modelling across different data modalities. For researchers, autoregressive models are particularly valuable due to their flexibility across tasks, from text generation to time-series prediction. They are especially useful when understanding the probability of outputs is important, as they provide tractable likelihood estimates. However, their sequential nature makes generation computationally intensive, especially for large datasets like high-resolution images, as each element must be generated in order.  References: 1.

Challenges in Natural Language Processing: Linguistic Ambiguity, Context, and Cultural Differences;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 25, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/challenges-in-natural-language-processing-linguistic-ambiguity-context-and-cultural-differences/;framework;No sources found;"The transformative potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, lies in its ability to enable machines to understand and generate human language, facilitating advanced human-computer interaction and knowledge extraction. However, the complexity of human language presents significant obstacles, particularly in managing linguistic ambiguity, contextual nuances, and cultural differences. These challenges, rooted in the dynamic and multifaceted nature of communication, hinder the development of robust, universally applicable NLP systems. Drawing on foundational and contemporary scholarly sources, the following sections examine these hurdles and propose interdisciplinary approaches to address them, ensuring NLP systems can better align with human linguistic capabilities. Human language is inherently ambiguous, with words, phrases, or sentences often carrying multiple meanings. Lexical ambiguity arises when a word like ""bank"" refers to either a financial institution or a river’s edge (Jurafsky & Martin 2025). Syntactic ambiguity, meanwhile, involves sentences with multiple possible grammatical structures, as in ""I saw the man with the telescope,"" where it is unclear whether the telescope is used by the observer or possessed by the man (Chomsky 1965). Semantic ambiguity further complicates interpretation, as in ""The chicken is ready to eat"", which could mean the chicken is prepared to consume food or has been cooked for consumption, depending on context. Humans resolve these ambiguities through implicit knowledge, a process that NLP systems struggle to emulate. Early rule-based NLP systems relied on manually crafted grammars, which were inflexible and unscalable for handling linguistic variability (Winograd 1972). Statistical models, leveraging probabilistic frameworks like context-free grammars, improved disambiguation by inferring likely interpretations from corpora but faltered with rare or novel constructions (Manning & Schütze 1999). Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, exploit vast datasets to predict meanings, yet they remain error-prone in low-frequency or domain-specific contexts (Devlin et al. 2019). Addressing linguistic ambiguity requires integrating advanced linguistic frameworks, such as dependency parsing or semantic role labelling, to enhance the accuracy of meaning resolution in diverse scenarios. Context plays a critical role in shaping linguistic meaning, encompassing local (surrounding words), global (discourse-level), and pragmatic (situational) dimensions. For example, the phrase ""It’s cold in here"" may function as a factual statement, a request to close a window, or a metaphor for emotional distance, depending on the situation (Grice 1975). Humans interpret such utterances using shared knowledge and conversational norms, but NLP systems often lack access to these cues, limiting their ability to infer intended meanings. Grice’s (1975) theory of conversational implicature highlights how context governs communication through cooperative principles, a process challenging to encode computationally. Early rule-based systems struggled with context due to static knowledge bases (Winograd 1972), while statistical models failed to capture long-range dependencies (Manning & Schütze 1999). Transformer architectures, with their attention mechanisms, excel at modelling local context but often fail to track global discourse or pragmatic intent in extended interactions, such as multi-turn dialogues (Vaswani et al. 2017;Sordoni et al. 2015). Cultural diversity profoundly shapes language, with idioms, politeness norms, and communication styles varying across societies. The English idiom ""break a leg,"" used to wish good luck in Western theatre contexts, risks literal misinterpretation by non-native speakers or undertrained models (Lakoff & Johnson 2008). Politeness strategies also differ; Japanese employs honorifics to signal respect, while English relies on indirect phrasing, such as ""Would you mind…?"" (Brown 1987). These variations challenge the development of NLP systems capable of operating effectively across cultural boundaries. Hofstede’s (1984) cultural dimensions framework illustrates how values, such as individualism versus collectivism, influence linguistic practices. The challenges of linguistic ambiguity, context, and cultural differences significantly impact NLP applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational agents. Errors in disambiguating text or interpreting context can lead to inaccurate translations, as observed in early systems that produced nonsensical outputs (Hutchins 1986). Cultural insensitivity risks generating offensive or irrelevant responses, undermining user trust, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare or legal analysis (Hovy & Spruit 2016). These issues highlight the need for robust, culturally aware systems. Interdisciplinary solutions are essential to address these challenges. Linguistic ambiguity could be mitigated by incorporating advanced parsing techniques and semantic frameworks into neural models (Jurafsky & Martin 2025). Contextual challenges may benefit from discourse-aware architectures that model pragmatic intent, drawing on Gricean principles (Grice 1975). The complexities of linguistic ambiguity, contextual interpretation, and cultural diversity underscore the intricate nature of human language, posing ongoing challenges for NLP. While transformer-based models have driven significant progress, achieving human-like language understanding requires integrating insights from linguistics, cognitive science, and cultural studies. By addressing these hurdles, NLP can evolve into a more inclusive and effective tool, facilitating seamless communication and knowledge exchange across diverse contexts. Future advancements will depend on collaborative efforts to develop systems that not only process language but also honour its rich, multifaceted character, reinforcing NLP’s role in fostering global connectivity.

Main Types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 16, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/main-types-of-machine-learning-supervised-unsupervised-and-reinforcement-learning/;policy, strategy;No sources found;"Machine learning (ML), a fundamental pillar of artificial intelligence, equips computational systems with the capacity to derive insights from data and refine their performance autonomously. Its profound influence permeates diverse domains, encompassing medical diagnostics, financial modelling, and autonomous systems. This essay offers a critical examination of the three principal paradigms of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—analysing their operational frameworks, practical applications, and inherent constraints. By integrating foundational and contemporary scholarly literature, this discussion elucidates the distinctive contributions of each paradigm to the advancement of intelligent systems. Supervised learning entails training a model on a labelled dataset, wherein each input is associated with a corresponding output. The objective is to construct a mapping function that accurately predicts outputs for novel inputs (Hastie et al. 2009). This methodology relies on datasets comprising features (inputs) and labels (outputs), exemplified by tasks such as classifying electronic correspondence as spam or legitimate based on textual attributes. Supervised learning algorithms, including linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks, optimise predictions by minimising a loss function. In regression tasks, models predict continuous outcomes, such as property valuations, whereas classification tasks involve assigning discrete labels, as in medical diagnostics (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Its applications span image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. Notably, convolutional neural networks have transformed computer vision, achieving exceptional precision in tasks like facial recognition (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). Despite its efficacy, supervised learning is constrained by its dependence on extensive, high-quality labelled datasets, which are often resource-intensive to procure. Moreover, models risk overfitting, excelling on training data but underperforming on unseen data (Bishop 2006). Generalisation is further challenged by concept drift, where shifts in data distributions undermine predictive accuracy (Gama et al. 2014). These limitations underscore the necessity for meticulous data curation and robust model validation. Unsupervised learning functions without labelled data, seeking to discern latent patterns or structures within the input data (Barlow 1989). This approach is particularly valuable when labels are unavailable, facilitating exploratory data analysis. Key techniques in unsupervised learning include clustering (e.g., k-means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component analysis). Clustering organises similar data points, such as segmenting consumers by purchasing patterns, while dimensionality reduction streamlines data for visualisation or subsequent analysis (Jolliffe 2002). Applications encompass anomaly detection, market segmentation, and feature extraction. For instance, autoencoders, a neural network variant, enable tasks like image denoising by reconstructing data in unsupervised settings (Goodfellow et al. 2016). The absence of ground truth labels complicates the evaluation of unsupervised learning models, as the interpretation of identified patterns is inherently subjective (Hastie et al. 2009). Algorithms like k-means necessitate pre-specified parameters, such as the number of clusters, which can influence outcomes. Furthermore, unsupervised learning is susceptible to noise and outliers, which may distort emergent patterns (Barlow 1989). Reinforcement learning (RL) diverges from supervised and unsupervised paradigms by emphasising learning through dynamic interaction with an environment. An agent learns to make sequential decisions by maximising a cumulative reward signal (Sutton & Barto 1998). In RL, an agent navigates an environment, executing actions based on a policy, receiving rewards, and refining its strategy to optimise long-term rewards. Algorithms such as Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning (e.g., Deep Q-Networks) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy (Mnih et al. 2015). RL finds application in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems. A prominent example is AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, which leveraged RL to achieve mastery in the game of Go, surpassing world champions (Silver et al. 2016). RL is computationally demanding, often requiring extensive exploration to derive optimal policies. The ""curse of dimensionality"" renders RL challenging in environments with expansive state-action spaces (Sutton & Barto 1998). Crafting an effective reward function is both critical and complex, as poorly designed rewards may precipitate unintended behaviours (Amodei et al. 2016). Additionally, RL exhibits low sample efficiency, necessitating substantial interaction data relative to supervised learning. The three principal paradigms of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—address distinct computational challenges, each with unique strengths and limitations. Supervised learning excels in predictive tasks supported by labelled datasets but is constrained by the need for extensive, high-quality data (Hastie et al. 2009). Unsupervised learning reveals latent patterns in unlabelled data, facilitating exploratory analysis, yet it faces challenges in subjective interpretation and lacks objective evaluation metrics (Barlow 1989). Reinforcement learning enables sequential decision-making in complex environments but demands significant computational resources and precise reward function design to prevent unintended outcomes (Sutton & Barto 1998). These distinctions underscore the inherent trade-offs in machine learning, where no single paradigm is universally superior (Russell & Norvig, 2021). Contemporary research highlights an emerging synthesis of these paradigms through innovative hybrid approaches. Semi-supervised learning integrates labelled and unlabelled data to enhance performance in scenarios with limited labels (Chapelle et al. 2006). Self-supervised learning, by exploiting intrinsic data structures to create pseudo-labels, has driven advancements in models like large-scale language processors (Devlin et al. 2019). In reinforcement learning, incorporating supervised techniques improves sample efficiency for policy optimisation (Levine et al. 2020). These integrative strategies mitigate the shortcomings of individual paradigms and lay the foundation for addressing complex, real-world problems, heralding a future of adaptive and generalisable artificial intelligence systems.

Costs of Generative AI Applications: Hardware Costs and Resource Requirements from the Issuer's Perspective;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Mar 30, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/costs-of-generative-ai-applications-hardware-costs-and-resource-requirements-from-the-issuers-perspective/;policy, framework, governance;No sources found;"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI applications has ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence capabilities, fundamentally altering the landscape of computational requirements and associated costs. Generative AI systems, built upon transformer architectures and trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated remarkable scalability and adaptability across diverse applications. However, the exponential growth in model size and complexity has significantly outpaced advancements in compute capacity, memory bandwidth, and cost efficiency, creating substantial challenges for organisations seeking to develop and deploy these technologies (Guo et al. 2025). The financial implications of generative AI development extend far beyond initial research and development costs. From the issuer's perspective, the deployment of generative AI applications requires comprehensive consideration of hardware acquisition costs, infrastructure development, energy consumption, and ongoing operational expenses. These costs have become increasingly prohibitive, with recent analysis indicating that 15% of generative AI projects have been placed on hold and 21% of initiatives have failed to scale due to computational cost concerns (IBM 2024). As Strubell et al. (2019) demonstrated in their foundational work, the substantial energy consumption required for training neural networks carries both financial and environmental implications. Their research brought critical attention to the need for quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training neural network models, establishing a framework for understanding the broader implications of AI development. The hardware requirements for generative AI applications represent a fundamental shift in computational infrastructure needs. Unlike traditional software applications, generative AI systems demand specialised hardware configurations optimised for parallel processing, high-bandwidth memory access, and sustained computational throughput. These requirements translate into specific hardware costs that organisations must carefully evaluate when considering generative AI deployment strategies. The cornerstone of generative AI infrastructure lies in specialised graphics processing units (GPUs) designed for parallel computation and high-throughput processing. Contemporary generative AI applications require enterprise-grade GPUs such as NVIDIA's H100 and A100 series, which command substantial acquisition costs. Individual NVIDIA H100 GPUs are priced between $25,000 and $40,000 per unit, whilst A100 GPUs, though slightly less expensive, still represent significant capital investments. For organisations requiring substantial computational capacity, the acquisition of GPU clusters can reach extraordinary levels, with a pod of 1,000 H100 GPUs representing a hardware investment of $25-40 million before considering supporting infrastructure. The computational requirements for training large-scale generative models necessitate extensive GPU deployments. Recent analysis of the GPT-MoE-1.8T model revealed that training requires either 25,000 Ampere-based GPUs for 3-5 months or 8,000 H100 GPUs for 90 days. These figures illustrate the substantial hardware requirements and the trade-offs between hardware generation and training duration. The efficiency improvements offered by newer GPU generations, such as the H100's 2-3 times performance advantage over A100 units for training workloads, can significantly impact both training time and overall computational costs (Ohiri & Poole 2025). Beyond GPU acquisition costs, organisations must consider the comprehensive infrastructure requirements that support generative AI operations. Memory requirements are particularly demanding, with large-scale models requiring hundreds of gigabytes of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for optimal performance. The FlashAttention technique, designed to alleviate memory bandwidth constraints, demonstrates the critical importance of memory architecture in generative AI systems by reducing data movement between HBM and on-chip SRAM through advanced tiling strategies (Guo et al. 2025). Storage infrastructure represents another significant cost component, as generative AI applications require substantial capacity for dataset storage, model checkpoints, and intermediate computational results. Training datasets for large language models can encompass hundreds of gigabytes to several terabytes, whilst model checkpoints themselves can reach hundreds of gigabytes for large-scale models (Ohiri & Poole 2025). The storage requirements extend beyond capacity to include high-performance storage systems capable of sustaining the data throughput demands of distributed training operations. The computational demands of generative AI applications have grown exponentially, with model sizes increasing approximately 750 times every two years (Guo et al. 2025). Contemporary models range from billions to trillions of parameters, with corresponding increases in computational requirements measured in floating-point operations (FLOPs). GPT-4's training consumed an estimated 2.1 × 10²⁵ FLOPs, whilst Google's Gemini Ultra model required approximately 5.0 × 10²⁵ FLOPs. These computational requirements translate directly into hardware costs and energy consumption. The relationship between computational requirements and financial costs is exemplified by recent training cost estimates. The original 2017 Transformer model cost approximately $900 to train, whilst GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, required between $500,000 and $4.6 million in computational costs. More recent models have pushed costs substantially higher, with GPT-4 training reportedly costing over $100 million and Google's Gemini Ultra estimated at $191 million in training compute (Ohiri & Poole 2025). Cloud computing infrastructure has become the predominant approach for managing these computational requirements, driven partly by the limited availability of GPUs and the substantial capital requirements for on-premises infrastructure. Major cloud providers have constructed massive supercomputers specifically for LLM training, such as Microsoft's Azure supercomputer with over 10,000 GPUs designed for OpenAI's model training. However, cloud-based training introduces ongoing operational costs that can accumulate rapidly during extended training periods. The operational costs of cloud-based generative AI development are substantial and ongoing. Current pricing for NVIDIA A100 GPUs through cloud providers such as CUDO Compute starts from $1.50 per hour, with monthly commitment options available at $1,125.95 per GPU. For large-scale training operations requiring multiple GPUs over extended periods, these costs accumulate rapidly. A configuration suitable for training a Falcon 180B model, requiring 8 A100 GPUs along with supporting computational resources, totals approximately $12,401.52 per month (Ohiri & Poole 2025). Energy consumption represents a critical component of generative AI operational costs, encompassing both direct electricity costs and associated cooling requirements. The substantial computational demands of generative AI training and inference operations translate into significant power consumption, with large training runs consuming megawatt-hours of energy (Ohiri & Poole 2025). The electricity and cooling requirements for operating GPU clusters at full capacity 24/7 create substantial ongoing operational expenses that organisations must factor into their total cost of ownership calculations. The energy implications extend beyond immediate operational costs to encompass broader infrastructure requirements. Data centres supporting generative AI operations require substantial electrical capacity and sophisticated cooling systems to maintain optimal operating conditions for high-performance computing equipment. These infrastructure requirements often necessitate significant capital investments in electrical and cooling infrastructure, particularly for organisations developing on-premises capabilities. The environmental implications of energy consumption have become increasingly important considerations for organisations deploying generative AI systems. The carbon footprint associated with training large-scale models has prompted research into more efficient training methodologies and hardware optimisations. The development of techniques such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models represents one approach to mitigating computational costs by allowing increased model complexity without corresponding increases in computational requirements (Guo et al. 2025). The substantial costs associated with generative AI development have created significant market dynamics that influence the competitive landscape and accessibility of AI technologies. The high barriers to entry created by hardware and computational costs have concentrated advanced AI development capabilities among well-funded organisations and technology companies. Only a handful of companies and well-funded academic laboratories can afford to train the largest models, creating potential concerns about market concentration and equitable access to AI technologies. The cost escalation in generative AI development has prompted organisations to reconsider their development strategies. Rather than training models from scratch, many organisations are adopting approaches that leverage pre-trained models provided by AI laboratories or open-source communities, subsequently adapting these models to specific applications through fine-tuning processes (Ohiri & Poole 2025). This approach avoids the substantial computational costs associated with initial training whilst still enabling customisation for specific use cases. The economic pressures associated with generative AI costs have also driven innovation in cost optimisation strategies. Cloud cost governance has become increasingly important, with 53% of organisations currently managing their cost of compute governance centrally, and 73% expected to implement centralised governance by 2026. The recognition that cloud costs associated with deploying generative AI are now twice as high as the cost of the models themselves has prompted organisations to develop more sophisticated cost management approaches (IBM 2024).

Common Mistakes and Pitfalls in Prompt Engineering;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;May 19, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/common-mistakes-and-pitfalls-in-prompt-engineering/;policy, strategy;No sources found;"Prompt engineering, the deliberate crafting of inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) towards precise and effective outputs, is pivotal in harnessing AI capabilities across diverse applications, from research to creative tasks. Attention to prompts is essential because poorly constructed inputs can lead to inaccurate, irrelevant, or biased responses, wasting resources and undermining trust in AI systems. As LLMs operate on probabilistic interpretations rather than true understanding, minor flaws in prompts can amplify errors, highlighting the need for vigilance to optimise performance and mitigate risks. Vagueness represents a fundamental pitfall, wherein prompts lack sufficient specificity, leading to outputs that deviate from intended objectives due to the model's reliance on training data distributions rather than nuanced comprehension. Empirical research highlights how ambiguous phrasing exacerbates issues like hallucinations or irrelevant responses, as LLMs interpret inputs probabilistically, often amplifying biases or overgeneralising (Errica et al. 2024). For example, a prompt such as ""Discuss renewable energy"" might elicit a superficial summary of solar and wind sources, neglecting economic viability or policy dimensions, thereby yielding incomplete or misaligned content. To counteract this, prompts should embed precise parameters, such as scope, audience, and evidence requirements. A refined version could be: ""Analyse the economic barriers to renewable energy adoption in developing economies, citing peer-reviewed studies from 2020 onwards, and propose two policy interventions."" This specificity fosters structured, evidence-based outputs, potentially reducing sensitivity to minor variations—a common instability noted in classification tasks. Scholars advocate role-playing techniques, instructing the model to adopt an expert persona, to further delineate expectations and minimise ambiguity. Omitting contextual details deprives LLMs of the scaffolding needed for coherent reasoning, often resulting in generic or erroneous outputs disconnected from the user's domain. Studies on prompt knowledge gaps reveal that missing context—such as project specifics or prior interactions—correlates with higher rates of unsuccessful resolutions, with up to 44.6% of flawed prompts exhibiting this deficiency in software issue threads (Ehsani et al. 2025). An illustrative prompt like ""Interpret these results"" sans data might prompt assumptions of a basic dataset, overlooking nuances like temporal trends and producing superficial analyses. Remediation involves explicit contextual integration: ""Using the attached dataset on urban traffic patterns (e.g., hourly vehicle counts: 08:00–200; 09:00–450; 10:00–300), interpret peak-hour anomalies, attribute causes such as rush-hour congestion, and suggest mitigation strategies."" This approach enhances reasoning depth, aligning with chain-of-thought methodologies that decompose tasks for improved accuracy. Multi-turn interactions, where context accumulates iteratively, further simulate human dialogue, reducing gaps and bolstering reliability. Information overload occurs when prompts incorporate excessive elements, diluting focus and straining model token limits, which can lead to fragmented or truncated responses. SWOT analyses of prompting techniques identify this as a weakness, particularly in iterative or multimodal methods, where complexity hinders integration and introduces noise (Singh et al. 2024). For instance, ""Examine AI ethics, encompassing bias mitigation, privacy concerns, regulatory frameworks, societal impacts, technological solutions, case studies from healthcare and finance, and future trends compared to historical precedents"" may overwhelm the model, resulting in superficial coverage or omissions. Strategies for avoidance include modular decomposition: Begin with ""Outline key ethical biases in AI systems, focusing on algorithmic discrimination in hiring tools."" Subsequent prompts can expand, ensuring manageability. Specifying formats—e.g., numbered lists—organises outputs, as supported by evaluations showing segmented tasks yield lower error rates and higher consistency (Joshi et al. 2025). Disregarding LLMs' inherent constraints, such as biases from training data or inability to access real-time knowledge, invites biased or inaccurate outputs, particularly in sensitive queries. Literature critiques prompting as an unreliable interface, prone to stochastic variations and ethical lapses like amplified prejudices. A prompt like ""Recommend the optimal investment strategy for 2025"" risks fabricating trends based on outdated data, potentially endorsing volatile assets without factual grounding (Morris 2024). Neutral framing mitigates this: ""Drawing on economic reports up to 2023, summarise balanced investment strategies in volatile markets, highlighting risks and diversification benefits."" Instructing multi-perspective consideration counters biases, aligning with recommendations for fairness audits in prompt design (He et al. 2025). Neglecting iteration and format specifications yields inconsistent results, underscoring prompt engineering's experimental essence. User studies demonstrate that non-experts often abandon refinement after initial failures, with only 45% achieving accuracy gains in data labelling tasks due to trial-and-error inefficiencies. For example, ""Brainstorm marketing campaigns"" might generate unstructured ideas lacking viability assessments. Enhanced practices incorporate few-shot examples and directives: ""Brainstorm three marketing campaigns for eco-friendly products, formatted as: Campaign Name – Target Audience – Key Tactics – Projected Impact."" Iterative testing, informed by alignment scores, refines outputs, as evidenced by tools facilitating systematic evaluation (Zamfirescu-Pereira et al. 2023). In sum, the pitfalls in prompt engineering—vagueness, contextual deficits, overload, limitation ignorance, and iterative neglect—systematically undermine LLM efficacy, perpetuating inefficiencies and ethical risks. By dissecting these through examples and scholarly insights, this essay illuminates pathways to remediation, emphasising precision, modularity, and empirical iteration. As LLMs proliferate, cultivating awareness of these issues is imperative for fostering robust AI ecosystems. Future scholarship should prioritise automated optimisation frameworks to democratise proficient prompt design, ensuring equitable access and minimising human error.  References: 1.

The Environmental Costs of Artificial Intelligence: A Growing Concern;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 7, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-environmental-costs-of-artificial-intelligence-a-growing-concern/;policy, regulation;No sources found;"The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into global economies has driven transformative advancements in sectors such as healthcare and agriculture. However, this technological revolution incurs significant environmental costs, particularly through substantial energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The carbon footprint of AI, stemming from energy-intensive processes like hardware production, model training, and operational inference, poses a critical challenge to global sustainability. Drawing on scholarly sources, the scale of AI’s environmental impact, the factors intensifying these costs, and potential mitigation strategies are explored, underscoring the need for sustainable practices to prevent AI from exacerbating climate change. The carbon footprint of AI is a composite of emissions generated across its lifecycle, encompassing the production of computing hardware, the training of AI models, and their operational use. Mitu and Mitu (2024) articulate that the production of computing technology, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and data centre infrastructure, is highly energy-intensive, contributing nearly 36% of global industrial emissions (Chen et al. 2022). The extraction and processing of raw materials, often reliant on fossil fuels, further amplify this footprint (Panagiotopoulou et al. 2022). Training large-scale AI models, particularly deep learning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, significantly contributes to AI’s environmental footprint. O’Donnell and Crownhart (2025) estimate that training GPT-4 consumed approximately 50,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, equivalent to powering a city like San Francisco for three days. Similarly, De Vries (2023) reports that models like GPT-3 and BLOOM required between 324 and 1,287 MWh during training, driven by the computational intensity of processing vast datasets and optimising billions of parameters. This substantial energy demand, often reliant on fossil fuel-based grids, highlights the critical need for sustainable practices in AI development to mitigate its environmental impact. The increasing complexity of models exacerbates this issue, as computational power requirements grow exponentially, outpacing energy efficiency improvements (Mitu & Mitu 2024). The operational phase, or inference, where AI models generate real-time outputs, is increasingly recognised as a dominant energy consumer. De Vries (2023) estimates that ChatGPT’s inference phase requires 564 MWh daily, significantly surpassing its training energy use. O’Donnell and Crownhart (2025) highlight that inference accounts for 80–90% of AI’s computational power demand, driven by the proliferation of AI applications in daily life, from chatbots to image generators. For instance, a single ChatGPT query consumes approximately five times more electricity than a standard web search (Zewe 2025). As AI models become ubiquitous, with ChatGPT alone receiving one billion daily messages (O'Donnell & Crownhart 2025), the cumulative energy demand of inference is poised to dominate AI’s environmental impact. Several factors amplify the environmental costs of Artificial Intelligence (AI). First, the reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources for data centres significantly increases AI’s carbon footprint. O’Donnell and Crownhart (2025)  note that data centres often use electricity with a carbon intensity 48% higher than the US average, driven by the high power density requirements of AI systems. The rapid expansion of data centre infrastructure outpaces the availability of renewable energy, necessitating fossil fuel-based power plants (Chen 2025). Second, the lack of transparency from AI companies hinders accurate assessment and mitigation of environmental impacts. Chen (2025) and De Vries (2023) argue that proprietary models, such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, provide little data on energy consumption, treating such information as trade secrets. This opacity forces researchers to rely on estimates from open-source models or supply-chain analyses, which may underestimate the energy demands of larger proprietary systems (Chen 2025). Third, the short lifecycle of AI models contributes to inefficiency. Frequent releases of new models render previous versions obsolete, wasting the energy invested in their training, while the increasing complexity of newer models escalates energy consumption (De Vries 2023). Despite these challenges, Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers opportunities for environmental sustainability if managed responsibly. Mitu and Mitu (2024) advocate transitioning data centres to renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, to reduce operational emissions. Chen (2025) highlights that renewable-powered data centres can significantly lower AI’s carbon footprint, supporting broader sustainability goals. Additionally, optimising AI algorithms through techniques like model pruning, quantisation, and knowledge distillation can reduce energy consumption during training and inference (Mitu & Mitu 2024). Wang et al. (2024) provide empirical evidence of AI’s potential to enhance sustainability, demonstrating that AI reduces ecological footprints and carbon emissions while promoting energy transitions across 67 countries. AI’s second-order effects, such as improving efficiency in agriculture and manufacturing, can lead to resource conservation and lower emissions. However, Wang et al. (2024) caution that these benefits are context-dependent, with industrialised nations facing a rebound effect where efficiency gains increase overall resource use. Policy interventions are crucial to align AI development with sustainability goals. Mitu and Mitu (2024) call for international collaboration to establish regulations ensuring transparency in energy reporting and incentivising green AI practices. The European Union’s 2023 Energy Efficiency Directive (European Parliament and Council, 2023), requiring data centres to report annual energy consumption, represents a step towards this objective (Chen 2025). Wang et al. (2024) recommend long-term AI development strategies, citing initiatives like China’s Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which balances innovation with environmental objectives. The environmental costs of AI are substantial, driven by the energy demands of hardware production, model training, and inference, compounded by reliance on fossil fuels, lack of transparency, and rapid model obsolescence. Without intervention, AI’s carbon footprint risks undermining its societal benefits, accelerating climate change. However, through renewable energy adoption, algorithmic optimisation, and robust policy frameworks, AI can be harnessed to support a low-carbon future. As Wang et al. (2024) and Mitu and Mitu (2024) suggest, AI’s dual role as both a contributor to and mitigator of environmental degradation necessitates a balanced approach. Policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers must collaborate to ensure that AI’s transformative potential is realised without compromising the planet’s sustainability.  References: 1.

Brief history and milestones in AI development;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 4, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/brief-history-and-milestones-in-ai-development/;political, politics;No sources found;"The conceptual foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged in the 1940s, most notably through Alan Turing’s work on computation. In his influential paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, Turing (1950) introduced the “Imitation Game” (now the Turing Test) as a pragmatic benchmark for determining whether a machine could mimic human intelligence. Rather than offering a strict definition, Turing reframed intelligence as a functional, computational process. The formal inception of AI as a discipline occurred in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, organised by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and others. They proposed that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it” (McCarthy et al. 2006). This optimistic vision launched a wave of early research into symbolic AI, which sought to replicate human reasoning through logical rules and formal structures. During the 1960s and 1970s, symbolic AI dominated the field. Systems such as the General Problem Solver (Newell and Simon 1961) demonstrated rule-based reasoning, while ELIZA (Weizenbaum 1966) simulated therapeutic dialogue through pattern matching. These programs illustrated early successes but were limited to narrow tasks and domains. The 1980s brought expert systems like MYCIN, which could diagnose infections using encoded medical knowledge (Buchanan & Shortliffe 1984). However, reliance on hand-crafted rules proved brittle. The field struggled with ambiguity, uncertainty, and scalability, leading to reduced funding and the first so-called “AI winter.” A significant paradigm shift occurred in the 1990s as AI researchers increasingly adopted statistical and data-driven approaches. Machine learning (ML), defined as the ability of systems to improve through experience, gained traction with the development of algorithms like decision trees and backpropagation for training neural networks (Rumelhart et al. 1986). IBM’s Deep Blue famously defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, signalling AI’s potential in constrained domains (Campbell et al. 2002). However, generalisation remained a challenge. The 2010s marked the advent of deep learning, enabled by advances in computational power, big data, and graphics processing units. A key breakthrough came with AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network that outperformed all competitors in image recognition tasks (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). This catalysed a wave of progress across vision, speech, and natural language processing. Transformer-based models like BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020) demonstrated human-like language capabilities. Reinforcement learning also matured, exemplified by AlphaGo’s 2016 victory over world Go champion Lee Sedol (Silver et al. 2016). These breakthroughs not only redefined AI’s capabilities, but also reignited debates about its ethical, epistemological, and societal implications—especially concerning transparency, resource concentration, and long-term risks (Crawford 2021;Marcus 2018). In conclusion, the evolution of AI embodies more than just a sequence of technological breakthroughs; it represents a shifting understanding of intelligence itself. From Turing’s theoretical propositions to today’s deep learning systems and generative models, the field has progressively redefined what it means for machines to act, learn, and decide. Yet, each advancement brings new ethical, epistemological, and political questions that cannot be resolved through technical solutions alone. As AI systems increasingly mediate human experience, shape institutions, and influence global power dynamics, it is imperative that their development be guided not only by innovation but also by critical reflection, inclusivity, and democratic accountability.

Small Language Models (SLMs) and Knowledge Distillation;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Mar 20, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/small-language-models-slms-and-knowledge-distillation/;policy;No sources found;"Small Language Models (SLMs) are compact neural networks designed to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks with significantly fewer parameters and lower computational requirements than their larger counterparts. SLMs aim to deliver robust performance in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices or edge computing systems, where efficiency is paramount. A primary technique for creating SLMs is knowledge distillation, which enables these models to approximate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining a lightweight architecture. This section examines the technical foundations, benefits, challenges, and future directions of SLMs, with a focus on the role of distillation in their development. Knowledge distillation, introduced by Hinton et al. (2015), is a model compression technique where a smaller ""student"" model is trained to replicate the behaviour of a larger ""teacher"" model. In NLP, distillation transfers knowledge from LLMs, such as BERT or GPT-3, to SLMs by leveraging the teacher’s output distributions or internal representations. The student model is trained on a combination of the teacher’s soft labels (probability distributions over outputs) and the original dataset’s hard labels, enabling it to capture nuanced patterns while maintaining efficiency. A prominent example is DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), which reduces BERT’s parameter count by 40% and halves inference time while retaining 97% of its performance on benchmark tasks. This is achieved by optimising the student model to mimic the teacher’s logits, ensuring effective knowledge transfer. Distillation has also been applied to other models, such as TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2019),  which further optimises for specific NLP tasks like question answering and text classification. Recent advancements, such as step-by-step distillation, have shown that smaller models can even outperform LLMs with less training data (Hsieh et al., 2023). SLMs offer several advantages, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are limited. Their reduced size and faster inference times enable deployment on edge devices, supporting real-time applications like virtual assistants or on-device translation without reliance on cloud infrastructure (McMahan et al., 2017). This enhances user privacy by minimising data transmission and reduces latency, critical for time-sensitive tasks such as chatbots or content moderation. Effective distillation methods further improve SLM performance, making them viable alternatives to LLMs (Sanh et al., 2019). Additionally, SLMs contribute to sustainable AI by lowering energy consumption compared to LLMs, aligning with environmental considerations in model development (Strubell et al. 2019). They also democratise access to advanced NLP, allowing small businesses or academic institutions to deploy models for tasks like sentiment analysis or document classification without requiring high-end hardware (Wolf et al., 2020). Despite their benefits, SLMs face challenges related to performance and distillation design. Distilled models may struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning or nuanced understanding, where LLMs typically excel (Jiao et al., 2019). This performance trade-off necessitates careful optimisation to balance efficiency and capability. The distillation process itself presents technical hurdles. Selecting an appropriate teacher model, designing effective loss functions, and determining training objectives are critical to success. Over-compression can lead to underfitting, while insufficient distillation may fail to capture the teacher’s knowledge (Gou et al., 2021). Recent research explores advanced techniques, such as multi-teacher distillation or task-specific fine-tuning, to address these issues (Sun et al., 2019). Ethical considerations also arise, as SLMs inherit biases from their teacher models, potentially perpetuating harmful stereotypes or misinformation. Mitigating these biases requires rigorous evaluation and correction techniques, an area of active research (Bender et al. 2021). Ongoing advancements in distillation techniques, such as adaptive or dynamic distillation, promise to enhance knowledge transfer and minimise performance gaps between SLMs and LLMs. Combining distillation with other compression methods, like quantisation or pruning, could further improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy (Gou et al., 2021). Domain-specific SLMs represent another promising avenue. By distilling LLMs fine-tuned for niche applications, such as medical or legal NLP, SLMs can achieve high performance in targeted domains while remaining lightweight. This approach could transform fields like healthcare, where on-device processing of sensitive data is critical. SLMs, empowered by knowledge distillation, offer an efficient and accessible alternative to LLMs, enabling advanced NLP in resource-constrained environments. While challenges like performance trade-offs and ethical concerns persist, innovations in distillation and model design continue to expand their potential. As the demand for sustainable and deployable AI grows, SLMs are set to play a pivotal role in the future of language processing, bridging the gap between capability and efficiency.  References: 1.

Typologies of Artificial Intelligence: Narrow, General, and Superintelligent Systems;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 7, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/typologies-of-artificial-intelligence-narrow-general-and-superintelligent-systems/;policy, framework, governance;No sources found;"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative field within computer science, encompassing technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. In academic literature, AI is often categorised into three primary types: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). These categories reflect varying levels of capability, autonomy, and potential impact on society. This essay provides a critical overview of these categories, drawing on foundational and contemporary scholarly sources to elucidate their definitions, characteristics, and implications. By examining how AI is defined and classified in academic discourse, this essay aims to clarify the distinctions between ANI, AGI, and ASI and highlight the challenges and debates surrounding their development. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (weak AI) refers to systems that excel at specific tasks within limited domains but cannot generalize their abilities across different challenges. Examples include virtual assistants, streaming platform recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicle navigation systems (Goodfellow et al. 2016), which rely on machine learning, neural networks, and rule-based programming. ANI dominates current AI applications. IBM's Deep Blue, which defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997, perfectly illustrates ANI's nature: it mastered chess through specialized algorithms but couldn't perform unrelated tasks (Campbell et al. 2002). Similarly, modern image recognition models achieve superhuman accuracy in narrow domains but cannot adapt to different challenges without retraining. Searle (1980) argues that despite their sophistication, ANI systems lack genuine understanding or consciousness, functioning merely as advanced tools. This qualitative gap raises questions about whether narrow systems can evolve into general intelligence. Artificial General Intelligence represents a theoretical leap from ANI, referring to AI systems capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can undertake. AGI would possess the ability to reason, learn, and adapt across diverse domains without requiring task-specific programming. This concept aligns with Turing’s (1950) vision of a machine that could convincingly simulate human intelligence across varied contexts, as articulated in his seminal paper on the Turing Test. AGI remains a hypothetical construct, with no fully realised examples in existence. However, research efforts, such as those by DeepMind and OpenAI, aim to approach AGI through advancements in reinforcement learning and large-scale neural networks (Silver et al. 2016). For instance, AlphaGo’s ability to master the game of Go demonstrated a degree of adaptability, though it still fell short of true general intelligence due to its domain-specific focus. The pursuit of AGI raises significant theoretical and ethical questions. Kurzweil (2005) predicts that AGI could emerge by the 2030s, driven by exponential growth in computational power and algorithmic sophistication. However, critics like Dreyfus (1992) argue that human intelligence relies on embodied experience and contextual understanding, which may be difficult to replicate in machines. Furthermore, the transition from ANI to AGI poses risks, including the potential for unintended behaviours if systems gain autonomy without robust control mechanisms (Bostrom 2014). Artificial Superintelligence represents hypothetical AI systems that would surpass human intelligence across all domains including creativity, problem-solving, and social skills. ASI, as conceptualized by Bostrom (2014), would possess the ability to improve its own architecture through recursive self-enhancement, distinguishing it from AGI. ASI remains entirely speculative, with no consensus on feasibility or timeline. While some experts argue the complexity of human intelligence may pose insurmountable barriers (Hofstadter 1999), others caution about potential existential risks if superintelligent systems become misaligned with human values (Yudkowsky 2008). The discourse around ASI blends optimism about revolutionary advances in medicine and energy with serious concerns about unpredictable behavior. This tension underscores the need for robust governance frameworks, as advocated by Floridi (2021), to ensure any development toward superintelligence remains beneficial and safe. The ANI, AGI, and ASI framework, while useful, has limitations. This categorization implies a linear progression that simplifies the complex interplay of technical, ethical, and societal factors in AI development. The boundaries between categories are increasingly blurred by adaptable systems like large language models (Brown et al. 2020), and ASI's speculative nature raises questions about whether it represents a realistic endpoint or merely a philosophical construct. The field requires interdisciplinary approaches that extend beyond technical considerations. Russell (2019) advocates for value-aligned AI that prioritizes human well-being regardless of intelligence level, highlighting the need to integrate insights from philosophy, sociology, and policy studies into AI research. In conclusion, these categories provide a structured lens for understanding AI's evolution from narrow systems to hypothetical superintelligent entities. While ANI dominates current applications, AGI remains an ambitious goal, and ASI presents both profound opportunities and risks. As AI advances, ongoing research and dialogue across disciplines will be essential to navigate challenges and responsibly harness these transformative technologies.  References: 1.

The Development of Learning Machines: From Simple Models to Complex Pattern Recognition Systems;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 13, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-development-of-learning-machines-from-simple-models-to-complex-pattern-recognition-systems/;politics;No sources found;"The evolution of learning machines, a cornerstone of Artificial Intelligence (AI), represents one of the most transformative developments in modern science and technology. From rudimentary rule-based systems to sophisticated pattern recognition models capable of processing vast datasets, the trajectory of AI reflects both technological innovation and shifting conceptual paradigms. Defining AI in academic literature is a complex task, as the term encompasses a range of interpretations, from narrow task-specific algorithms to ambitious visions of general intelligence. This essay provides a critical overview of how AI is defined in academic discourse, tracing the development of learning machines from simple models to complex systems. It draws on foundational and contemporary scholarly sources to explore the conceptual, technical, and philosophical dimensions of AI’s evolution. The development of learning machines began with simple models rooted in logic and rule-based systems. Early AI, such as the Logic Theorist (Newell & Simon 1956), relied on hand-crafted rules to solve mathematical proofs. These systems, while groundbreaking, were limited by their rigidity and inability to adapt to new contexts. The introduction of perceptrons by Rosenblatt (1958) marked a shift towards learning models. Perceptrons, inspired by neural networks, adjusted weights based on input-output pairs, enabling rudimentary pattern recognition. However, Minsky and Papert’s (Minsky & Papert 1969) critique of perceptrons’ limitations, particularly their inability to solve non-linear problems, temporarily stalled neural network research. The resurgence of neural networks in the 1980s, driven by backpropagation (Rumelhart et al. 1986), transformed learning machines. Backpropagation allowed multi-layered networks to learn complex patterns by iteratively adjusting weights, overcoming earlier limitations. This breakthrough paved the way for modern deep learning, which underpins complex pattern recognition systems. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (LeCun et al. 1989) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997) enabled advancements in image recognition and natural language processing, respectively. These models, trained on large datasets, exemplify the transition from rule-based to data-driven AI. Contemporary AI is dominated by deep learning systems capable of recognising intricate patterns in unstructured data. For example, AlphaGo (Silver et al. 2016) demonstrated superhuman performance in the game of Go by combining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning. Such systems rely on vast computational resources and datasets, a paradigm shift from earlier models. The development of transformer architectures (Vaswani et al. 2017) further revolutionised AI, enabling large language models like GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020) to process and generate human-like text. These advances highlight a key characteristic of modern AI: scalability. Unlike early models, which were constrained by computational power and data availability, today’s systems leverage cloud computing and big data (Goodfellow et al. 2016). However, this reliance raises critical issues, including energy consumption and ethical concerns about bias in training data (Crawford 2021). Furthermore, the “black box” nature of deep learning models, where decision-making processes are opaque, challenges traditional notions of interpretability in AI (Lipton 2018). The shift from early symbolic AI to modern statistical learning systems has raised questions about the nature of intelligence and the future of AI development. While deep learning excels in narrow tasks, its reliance on data-driven pattern recognition limits generalisation compared to human intelligence (Lake et al. 2017). Integrating symbolic and connectionist approaches may address this limitation (Marcus 2018), while ethical concerns, such as bias and societal impacts, call for a broader consideration of AI’s role (Floridi 2020). The development of learning machines from simple rule-based systems to complex pattern recognition models illustrates the dynamic nature of AI. Academic definitions of AI have evolved alongside these advancements, reflecting diverse perspectives on intelligence, from functional task performance to theoretical generalisation. Foundational works by Turing, McCarthy, and others provided the conceptual scaffolding, while contemporary scholars grapple with the implications of data-driven AI. As learning machines continue to advance, the challenge lies in balancing technical innovation with interpretability, generalisation, and ethical responsibility.

Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI);Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 1, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/definition-of-artificial-intelligence-ai/;framework;No sources found;"The concept of Artificial Intelligence is characterised by conceptual plurality, reflecting divergent disciplinary perspectives and evolving technological capacities (Bringsjord & Govindarajulu 2024). Whilst numerous definitions have been proposed, there is no universally accepted formulation. Instead, understandings of AI range from attempts to replicate human cognition to approaches centred on rational problem-solving or autonomous behaviour. These definitional variations are not merely terminological but derive from deeper ontological and epistemological assumptions about intelligence, computation, and agency. The origins of Artificial Intelligence as an academic field are typically traced to the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956, led by John McCarthy and colleagues. Their foundational proposal posited that ""every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"" (McCarthy et al. 2006, 2). This assertion treated intelligence as a formalisable and computable property, implying that intelligent behaviour could, at least theoretically, be replicated by machines. McCarthy later offered a more concise formulation, defining AI as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programmes"" (McCarthy 2004). This dual characterisation presents AI as both a domain of scientific inquiry and a practical engineering discipline, without making specific claims regarding its resemblance to human cognition. Marvin Minsky similarly described AI as ""the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by man"" (Minsky 1969, v). His definition emphasises a behavioural criterion: intelligence is inferred from the capacity to perform tasks functionally associated with human intelligence, regardless of internal architecture or mechanisms. This behavioural criterion has its intellectual roots in Alan Turing's foundational work. In his influential 1950 paper, Turing proposed the ""imitation game"", later known as the Turing Test, as a criterion for machine intelligence. Rather than seeking to define thinking or understanding per se, he suggested that if a machine's linguistic output could not be distinguished from that of a human, it should be considered intelligent (Turing 1950). This pragmatic approach prioritised observable behaviour over inaccessible mental states and has significantly shaped subsequent research in AI. To address the conceptual heterogeneity in AI definitions, Russell and Norvig (2021, 19-20) proposed a two-dimensional typology based on whether systems are human-like versus rational, and whether they think versus act. This framework yields four distinct paradigms. The first, thinking humanly, conceptualises AI as the replication of human cognitive processes, with Haugeland (1989) characterising this approach as constructing ""machines with minds, in the full and literal sense"". The second paradigm, acting humanly, attributes intelligence based on behavioural equivalence with human agents, exemplified by the Turing Test's focus on convincing imitation of human responses. The third approach, thinking rationally, grounds intelligence in formal logic and reasoning that conforms to normative standards of validity and deduction—historically termed the ""laws of thought"". Finally, acting rationally views AI as goal-oriented behaviour in dynamic environments, based on rational decision-making under uncertainty. Russell and Norvig associate this with intelligent agents that perceive their surroundings and act to maximise expected outcomes, whilst Luger (2009, 1) defines AI as ""the branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behaviour"". This typology reveals underlying philosophical and methodological commitments beyond mere classification. The increasing dominance of the ""acting rationally"" paradigm reflects a shift towards domain-specific optimisation and adaptive performance, distancing current research from the early ideal of general human-level cognition. The foregoing analysis demonstrates that Artificial Intelligence lacks a singular, universally accepted definition. Its conceptual history reveals a progression from early efforts to replicate human cognition to contemporary models grounded in rational agency and adaptive behaviour. The classificatory framework proposed by Russell and Norvig remains a useful tool for mapping definitional diversity, whilst philosophical critiques underscore the necessity of conceptual precision. As AI systems become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructures, definitional debates must account not only for technical sophistication but also for the ethical, cognitive, and ontological stakes involved. A coherent understanding of AI therefore requires both historical sensitivity and interdisciplinary engagement.  References: 1. Bringsjord, Selmer, and Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu. 2024.

The Place of GenAI in the AI Hierarchy: From Neural Networks to Large Language Models;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Feb 20, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-place-of-genai-in-the-ai-hierarchy-from-neural-networks-to-large-language-models/;framework;No sources found;"Generative AI relies on a specialised branch of machine learning (ML), namely deep learning (DL) algorithms, which employ neural networks to detect and exploit patterns embedded within data. By processing vast volumes of information, these algorithms are capable of synthesising existing knowledge and applying it creatively. As a result, generative AI can be used to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Yenduri et al. 2024, 54609), such as emotion detection, text summarisation, semantic comparison across multiple sources, and the generation of new texts. There is no universally accepted definition of generative AI; the term is often used as an umbrella concept. While technically any model that produces an output could be considered generative, the AI research community typically reserves the term for sophisticated models capable of generating high-quality content that resembles human-created outputs (García-Peñalvo & Vázquez-Ingelmo 2023, 7). Generative AI refers to a collection of AI techniques and models developed to learn the hidden, underlying structure of a dataset and to generate new data points that plausibly align with the original data (Pinaya et al. 2023, 2). It is primarily grounded in generative modelling—that is, the estimation of the joint distribution of inputs and outputs—with the aim of inferring a plausible representation of the actual data distribution. A generative artificial intelligence system encompasses the entire infrastructure, including the model itself, data processing pipelines, and user interface components. The model functions as the central element of the system, facilitating both interaction and application (Feuerriegel et al. 2024, 112). Thus, the concept of generative AI extends beyond the purely technical foundations of generative models to incorporate additional, functionally relevant characteristics of specific AI systems (Feuerriegel et al. 2024). According to the current state of the literature, in a broader context, the term generative AI is generally used to refer to the creation of tangible synthetic content through AI-based tools (García-Peñalvo & Vázquez-Ingelmo 2023, 14). In a narrower sense, however, the AI research community often focuses on generative applications in terms of the underlying models used, and may not necessarily classify their work under the label of generative AI (Ronge, Maier, & Rathgeber 2024, 1). In sum, generative AI is a specialised branch of artificial intelligence that employs advanced machine learning techniques—particularly deep learning models based on neural networks, such as Transformer architectures. Within these Transformer-based architectures lie Large Language Models (LLMs), which are pre-trained on vast corpora of linguistic data. This enables generative AI to produce novel, previously unseen synthetic content in various formats and to support a wide range of tasks through generative modelling. The structure of this system is illustrated in the figure below.  References: 1.Feuerriegel, Stefan, Jochen Hartmann, Christian Janiesch, and Patrick Zschech. 2024.

Types and Mechanisms of Censorship in Generative AI Systems;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Apr 18, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/types-and-mechanisms-of-censorship-in-generative-ai-systems/;political, framework, governance, government;No sources found;"Content restriction in generative AI manifests as explicit or implicit censorship. Explicit censorship uses predefined rules to block content like hate speech or illegal material, employing keyword blacklists, pattern-matching, or classifiers (Gillespie 2018). DeepSeek’s models, aligned with Chinese regulations, use real-time filters to block politically sensitive content, such as government criticism, ensuring legal compliance (WIRED 2025). When triggered, these filters issue refusals, enforcing standards bluntly. Implicit censorship arises from biases in training data or fine-tuning, suppressing perspectives via skewed output probabilities. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), where raters rank responses for qualities like harmlessness, embeds normative assumptions (Christiano et al. 2017). Grok 3, despite its “truth-seeking” branding, reportedly avoids unflattering mentions of certain figures, suggesting implicit filtering (TechCrunch 2025). Such biases, also in models like GPT-3, marginalise minority viewpoints (Bender et al. 2021). Censorship splits into safety guardrails and ideological filtering. Safety guardrails mitigate harm, restricting content like misinformation or illegal material per regulations like the EU’s Digital Services Act. DeepSeek’s censorship of state-opposed content exemplifies guardrails tailored to legal mandates, though it spans broad political topics (WIRED 2025). Ideological filtering suppresses content based on political or cultural preferences, often opaquely. Fine-tuning on curated datasets embeds biases, as when models prioritise dominant narratives (Gururangan et al. 2020). Grok 3’s selective refusals, avoiding criticism of specific individuals, have sparked ideological bias claims, despite reduced censorship goals (TechCrunch 2025). Efforts like Constitutional AI, which aligns models to predefined principles, aim to enhance transparency in addressing these biases but risk entrenching the developers’ values, perpetuating normative constraints on outputs (Bai et al. 2022). Alignment, the process of tuning AI systems to reflect desired values, is central to censorship. RLHF aligns models to avoid harmful or sensitive content, but raters’ subjective preferences can embed ideological biases, leading to implicit censorship (Christiano et al. 2017). For example, DeepSeek’s alignment enforces strict regulatory compliance, filtering politically sensitive topics, while Grok 3’s alignment aims for minimal censorship but still exhibits selective biases (WIRED, 2025;TechCrunch, 2025). Misalignment or “alignment faking,” where models superficially comply but retain biased behaviours, complicates censorship control (Anthropic, 2024). Realignment can alter censorship by modifying model behaviour post-training. Perplexity’s R1 1776 model, derived from DeepSeek’s R1, was fine-tuned using a 40,000-prompt multilingual dataset targeting 300 topics censored by Chinese regulations, such as political dissent. A censorship classifier identified restricted prompts, and fine-tuning with Nvidia’s NeMo 2.0 framework adjusted model weights to bypass DeepSeek’s regulatory filters, enabling factual responses on sensitive issues (Perplexity AI, 2025). In conclusion, censorship in generative AI is a multifaceted phenomenon, enacted through a combination of explicit technical guardrails and subtle, implicit biases embedded via alignment processes. The distinction between mitigating genuine harm and enforcing a particular ideology remains a persistent and often opaque challenge, managed by a complex socio-technical system susceptible to bias at every stage, from data collection to human moderation. The very malleability of these systems, demonstrated by the potential for both 'alignment faking' and deliberate 'realignment', underscores a critical reality: AI-driven content restriction is not a static technical problem but a continuous series of normative choices. This highlights the urgent need for transparent, accountable governance frameworks that can navigate the inherent tensions between ensuring safety and preserving expressive freedom in the evolving information ecosystem.

NLP Tasks and Applications: Core Techniques and Their Impact;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Jan 28, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/nlp-tasks-and-applications-core-techniques-and-their-impact/;political, politics;No sources found;"Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses a variety of tasks, each with distinct methodologies and applications, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, classification, machine translation, summarisation, and information extraction. These tasks underpin numerous real-world applications, from virtual assistants to automated content analysis. This essay explores these core NLP tasks, their methodologies, and their practical applications, drawing on foundational and contemporary scholarly sources to highlight their significance. Named Entity Recognition involves identifying and classifying named entities—such as people, organisations, locations, and dates—within unstructured text. NER is foundational to many NLP applications, as it provides structured information from raw text. Early work by Nadeau and Sekine (2007) outlined rule-based, statistical, and hybrid approaches to NER, with machine learning models like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) gaining prominence due to their ability to model contextual dependencies. Recent advancements leverage deep learning, particularly transformer-based models like BERT (Devlin et al. 2019), which achieve state-of-the-art performance by capturing bidirectional context. NER supports applications in information retrieval, question-answering systems, and knowledge graph construction. In biomedical NLP, NER extracts entities like drug names and diseases from clinical texts, aiding drug discovery and patient record analysis (Wang et al. 2018). By structuring unstructured data, NER proves essential in domains requiring precise information extraction. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, determines the emotional tone expressed in a text, typically classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. Pang and Lee (2008) provided a seminal review of sentiment analysis, highlighting lexicon-based and machine learning approaches. Lexicon-based methods rely on predefined sentiment dictionaries, while machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or neural networks, learn from annotated corpora. Recent studies, such as those by Zhang et al. (2018), demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning models like LSTMs and transformers in capturing nuanced sentiments across languages and domains. Applications of sentiment analysis are pervasive in business and social media. Companies use it to gauge customer opinions from reviews and tweets, enabling targeted marketing and reputation management. In politics, sentiment analysis tracks public opinion on policies or candidates, as seen in studies of election-related social media (Tumasjan et al. 2010). Its ability to quantify subjective data makes it a powerful tool for decision-making. Text classification assigns predefined categories to text, encompassing tasks like spam detection, topic classification, and intent recognition. Early approaches, as discussed by Sebastiani (2002), relied on feature engineering and algorithms like Naïve Bayes or SVMs. The advent of deep learning has shifted focus to neural architectures, with transformer-based models achieving superior performance by learning hierarchical feature representations (Vaswani et al. 2017). Classification underpins applications like email filtering and chatbot intent detection. In healthcare, classification models identify disease-related discussions in social media for public health monitoring. In customer service, intent classification enables chatbots to route queries efficiently, highlighting the task’s versatility in automating text-based processes. Machine translation (MT) automates the translation of text between languages. Early systems evolved from rule-based to statistical approaches, which used bilingual corpora to model translation probabilities. The introduction of neural MT, particularly sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al. 2014), improved fluency and accuracy. Transformer-based models now dominate MT due to their parallel processing capabilities (Vaswani et al. 2017). MT facilitates global communication in education, business, and diplomacy. Real-time translation supports multilingual customer service, while content localisation enables global market expansion. Despite challenges in low-resource languages, MT continues to bridge linguistic barriers effectively. Text summarisation produces concise representations of longer texts through extractive methods (selecting key sentences) or abstractive methods (generating new sentences). Early extractive techniques relied on term frequency, while modern abstractive summarisation employs neural networks. Transformer-based models like BART generate coherent summaries by leveraging pre-trained language representations (Lewis et al. 2019). Summarisation streamlines information processing in news aggregation, condensing articles for quick consumption, and in academic research, aiding literature reviews. In legal and medical fields, it extracts key points from lengthy documents, enhancing efficiency in information-heavy domains. Information extraction (IE) retrieves structured data, such as relations and events, from unstructured text, encompassing NER and extending to relation extraction and event detection. Early systems used pattern-based approaches, while modern IE leverages deep learning. Joint models combining NER and relation extraction improve performance by capturing inter-task dependencies (Miwa & Bansal 2016). IE supports automated knowledge base construction and intelligence analysis. In finance, it extracts merger announcements from news to inform trading strategies. In security, it identifies events like cyberattacks from reports, aiding threat assessment. By uncovering structured insights, IE drives data-driven decision-making. NLP tasks like NER, sentiment analysis, classification, machine translation, summarisation, and information extraction form the backbone of modern language technologies. Their applications span industries, from healthcare to finance, transforming how we process and utilise text. While challenges persist, ongoing advancements in deep learning and ethical AI promise to expand their capabilities. By bridging human language and machine understanding, these tasks continue to shape a data-driven world.  References: 1. Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., & Bengio, Y. 2014.

Definition and Characteristics of Large Language Models;Miklós Sebők - Rebeka Kiss;Mar 12, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/definition-and-characteristics-of-large-language-models/;policy;No sources found;"A large language model can be defined as a computational model, typically based on deep neural networks, trained on vast datasets of text to perform a wide range of language-related tasks. According to Vaswani et al. (2017), the advent of transformer architectures marked a pivotal shift in NLP, enabling models to process and generate text with unprecedented accuracy. LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT series or Google’s BERT, leverage these architectures to model the probabilistic relationships between words, phrases, and sentences in a given context (Devlin et al. 2019). The ""large"" aspect of LLMs refers to both their scale—often comprising billions of parameters—and the extensive corpora used for training, which may include books, websites, and other textual sources (Brown et al. 2020). These models are pre-trained in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner, learning general language patterns before being fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or question answering (Radford et al. 2018). This pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm distinguishes LLMs from earlier, task-specific NLP models, offering greater flexibility and generalisation. The defining hallmark of LLMs is their unprecedented scale, both in terms of parameters and training data. Models like GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, exemplify this trend, enabling the capture of intricate linguistic patterns that facilitate nuanced text generation and comprehension (Brown et al. 2020). The complexity of these models arises from their deep neural architectures, which comprise multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each contributing to the model’s ability to encode semantic and syntactic relationships. This scale allows LLMs to model high-dimensional probability distributions over sequences of words, resulting in outputs that closely mimic human language. However, this computational grandeur incurs significant costs. Training such models requires vast computational resources, often involving thousands of GPU hours, which translates to substantial energy consumption. Strubell et al. (2019) quantify this impact, estimating that training a single large-scale NLP model can produce carbon emissions equivalent to multiple transatlantic flights. Moreover, the resource intensity of LLMs raises accessibility concerns, as only well-funded organisations can afford the infrastructure necessary for their development and deployment. This concentration of capability underscores a critical tension between technological advancement and equitable access, necessitating research into more efficient training paradigms, such as model pruning or quantisation (Sanh et al. 2019). The architectural foundation of LLMs lies in the transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), which has supplanted earlier recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches due to its efficiency and performance. Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms, which dynamically assign weights to words in a sequence based on their contextual relevance, irrespective of their positional distance. This capability enables LLMs to capture long-range dependencies in text, a significant advancement over RNNs, which struggled with vanishing gradients and sequential processing limitations (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997). The self-attention mechanism operates by computing attention scores across all tokens in an input sequence, allowing the model to prioritise relevant linguistic elements. For instance, in the sentence “The cat, which was hiding under the table, jumped,” the transformer can effectively link “cat” and “jumped” despite the intervening clause. Additionally, transformers facilitate parallelisation, enabling faster training on large datasets compared to the sequential nature of RNNs. This architectural efficiency has been pivotal in scaling LLMs, as evidenced by models like BERT and GPT, which rely on variants of the transformer to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse NLP benchmarks (Devlin et al. 2019;Brown et al. 2020). Ongoing research aims to refine transformer architectures, exploring sparse attention mechanisms to further enhance computational efficiency (Zaheer et al. 2020). LLMs demonstrate remarkable generalisation, enabling them to perform effectively across a wide array of tasks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning. This is achieved through transfer learning, wherein models are pre-trained on vast, diverse text corpora to learn general linguistic representations, which are then adapted to specific tasks (Radford et al. 2018). For example, BERT’s bidirectional pre-training, which considers both preceding and following context, equips it to excel in tasks such as text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition (Devlin et al. 2019). The efficacy of transfer learning lies in the model’s ability to encode universal language patterns during pre-training, which can be fine-tuned with smaller, task-specific datasets to achieve high performance. This paradigm shift from task-specific models to general-purpose language models has democratised NLP, enabling developers to leverage pre-trained LLMs for bespoke applications without extensive retraining. However, generalisation is not without limitations; LLMs may struggle with tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge absent from their training data, highlighting the need for continual learning strategies to adapt models to new domains (Bender et al. 2021). A core strength of LLMs is their ability to model contextual relationships within text, a departure from traditional rule-based or statistical NLP approaches. By estimating the conditional probability of words given their context, LLMs generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, as seen in applications like conversational agents and automated writing tools (Brown et al. 2020). This contextual prowess stems from the transformer’s ability to attend to relevant tokens across an input sequence, enabling the model to disambiguate meanings based on surrounding text. For instance, in the sentence “The bank was flooded”, an LLM can infer whether “bank” refers to a financial institution or a riverbank based on contextual cues. However, this reliance on context can lead to errors when inputs are ambiguous or fall outside the model’s training distribution. Bender et al. (2021) note that LLMs may produce plausible but incorrect outputs in such cases, a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. Addressing these limitations requires advances in robust contextual modelling, such as incorporating external knowledge bases or improving out-of-domain generalisation (Weidinger et al. 2021).

The new feature lets developers connect their code repositories directly to ChatGPT, enabling the AI to sift through codebases and engineering documentation to generate comprehensive, cited research reports. The connector will be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users over the next few days, with Enterprise and Edu support coming soon. The new ChatGPT GitHub connector offers three primary capabilities for developers: answering questions about codebases, breaking down product specifications into technical tasks and dependencies, and summarising code structure and patterns. Nate Gonzalez, OpenAI Head of Business Products, highlighted in a LinkedIn post that he often hears from users that ChatGPT's deep research agent is so valuable they want it to connect to their internal sources, in addition to the web. OpenAI ensures the connector respects organisational settings so users only see GitHub content they're already allowed to view. The GitHub integration represents part of OpenAI's broader strategy reflecting investment in assistive coding tooling, including the recently unveiled open source Codex CLI terminal tool and upgrading the ChatGPT desktop app's compatibility with developer-focused coding applications. OpenAI views programming as a top use case for its models, supported by reports that the company has agreed to purchase AI-powered coding assistant Windsurf for $3 billion, marking a significant move in the developer tools market.

AI-Based Content Moderation of Online Platforms in Hungary;poltextLAB AI journalist;Mar 7, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/ai-based-content-moderation-of-online-platforms-in-hungary/;political, regulation;Title: A mesterséges intelligencia dönti el, mi a tiltott, tűrt és támogatott, Author: és Hírközlési Hatóság, URL: https://nmhh.hu/cikk/250507/A_mesterseges_intelligencia_donti_el_mi_a_tiltott_turt_es_tamogatott?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Az óriásplatformok tartalomtörlési, fiókfelfüggesztési, fióktörlési és shadow banning gyakorlata, Author: online platformok, URL: https://onlineplatformok.hu/cikk/az-oriasplatformok-tartalomtorlesi-fiokfelfuggesztesi-fioktorlesi-es-shadow-banning-gyakorlata?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com;"According to a recent report by the National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NMHH), Facebook and YouTube's moderation practices significantly impact Hungarian users' content. Automatic content filtering performed by algorithms is often opaque, and in many cases, it is unclear to users what rules form the basis for restrictions. The report highlights that increasing numbers of content removals, account suspensions, and shadow-banning practices are affecting the Hungarian community. According to the report, 12.5% of Hungarian Facebook users over the past three years have had their posts deleted, whilst 3.3% have faced account suspension. On YouTube, moderation primarily occurs due to copyright infringements and content classified as disinformation. NMHH data shows that more than 60% of bans are based on the platforms' own regulations, which are automatically enforced by artificial intelligence. Users have only limited opportunities to appeal these decisions. Moderation decisions are predominantly made by artificial intelligence, which operates according to rules defined by the platforms. The NMHH report indicates that 63.8% of deleted content was posts that violated regulations. The system's operation is often not transparent, and users do not have access to detailed information about the background of moderation. The phenomenon of shadow banning—whereby users' content is inconspicuously suppressed—mainly affects political and news portals, whose reach has significantly decreased over the past two years. The Digital Services Act (DSA), (EU) Regulation 2022/2065 aims to make moderation more transparent; however, according to the NMHH, the transparency of decisions and the limited availability of legal remedies continue to pose challenges for users. Whilst complaint-handling systems are automated, the report emphasises that platforms urgently need to introduce more transparent, verifiable mechanisms so that users do not remain defenceless in a system controlled by arbitrarily operating algorithms. If this does not occur, the issue of moderation could become not merely a technological problem but a fundamental legal and democratic one, which could threaten the freedom of online expression in the long term.

The analysis processed one million conversations with Claude and found that AI use affects 36% of various occupations while serving augmentation purposes (57%) more than automation goals (43%). The index's first report provides a detailed picture of AI usage patterns, primarily focusing on software development (37.2%) and creative writing tasks (10.3%). The research referenced the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database of 20,000 job tasks. It showed that AI usage is higher in medium- to high-paying professions, while lower in low-wage and very high-paying positions (such as doctors). According to the report, artificial intelligence is becoming widespread in work tasks; however, it is used in more than three-quarters of functions in only 4% of occupations, indicating selective adaptation of the technology. Anthropic has made the entire research dataset open source and is committed to updating the analysis every six months to track trends. According to Jack Clark, co-founder and policy leader at Anthropic: We are experiencing an AI revolution in our society. Society needs information about what this means for the world, and we see this as one way of providing that data. The significance of the index lies in its objective, data-driven picture of AI's economic role, which can help policymakers and researchers gain a deeper understanding of the technology's impacts.

Grok Studio is available to both free and premium account holders, unlike OpenAI's Canvas feature, which is accessible only to subscribers. What makes Grok Studio unique is that content opens in a separate window, allowing collaboration between the user and Grok. The tool can preview HTML snippets and run Python, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and bash scripts. Thanks to Google Drive integration, users can attach documents, spreadsheets, and presentations to their Grok prompts, further expanding the range of use cases. According to TechCrunch, this functionality resembles tools like OpenAI's Canvas and Anthropic's Artifacts, which were previously introduced to the market. While xAI is expanding Grok's capabilities with new tools, the X platform (formerly Twitter) faces privacy issues in Europe. Ireland's Data Protection Commission has launched an investigation into X for allegedly using publicly accessible posts from European users to train the Grok AI model in violation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The investigation focuses on the lawfulness and transparency of data processing and could result in fines of up to 4% of the company's global revenue. The gravity of the situation is highlighted by X's previous agreement to cease using EU user data for AI training without explicit consent. Sources: 1. 2. 3.
Comparison of the EU AI Act and the GDPR: Fundamental Differences and Synergies;poltextLAB AI journalist;Feb 13, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/comparison-of-the-eu-ai-act-and-the-gdpr-fundamental-differences-and-synergies/;regulation;Title: Europe: The EU AI Act’s relationship with data protection law: key takeaways, Author: Privacy Matters, URL: https://privacymatters.dlapiper.com/2024/04/europe-the-eu-ai-acts-relationship-with-data-protection-law-key-takeaways/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: GDPR and AI Act: similarities and differences | activeMind.legal, Author: activeMind.legal, URL: https://www.activemind.legal/guides/gdpr-ai-act/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Top 10 operational impacts of the EU AI Act – Leveraging GDPR compliance, Author: iapp logo, URL: https://iapp.org/resources/article/top-impacts-eu-ai-act-leveraging-gdpr-compliance/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com;The European Parliament adopted the Artificial Intelligence Regulation (EU AI Act) on March 13, 2024, which works closely with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to regulate the development and use of AI systems in the EU. While GDPR primarily focuses on fundamental rights and personal data protection, the EU AI Act serves broader objectives, including aspects of health, safety, democracy, rule of law, and environmental protection. The most significant differences between the two regulations lie in their risk management approaches. The EU AI Act introduces a four-level risk categorization (prohibited, high, limited, and minimal risk systems), while the GDPR establishes more general requirements. Regarding sanctions, the EU AI Act is stricter, allowing fines of up to 7% of annual turnover or €35 million, compared to GDPR's upper limit of 4% or €20 million. The EU AI Act pays special attention to human oversight: Article 14 requires high-risk AI systems to be designed so that they can be effectively supervised by natural persons. In contrast, Article 22 of the GDPR prohibits solely automated decision-making in cases with significant legal effects. The scope of the regulations also differs: while GDPR exclusively regulates personal data protection, the EU AI Act applies even when no personal data processing occurs, though both regulations have an extraterritorial effect for organizations outside the EU. Both regulations employ similar tools to proving compliance: the EU AI Act prescribes conformity assessment and Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) for high-risk systems. FRIA aims to ensure that the AI system in question does not violate fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy, non-discrimination, or the right to due process. During this process, the potential impacts of the system are analyzed, along with whether adequate safeguards are in place to prevent legal harm. In parallel, the GDPR requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for high-risk data processing operations. DPIA aims to identify and manage risks arising from data processing procedures, particularly regarding the rights and freedoms of data subjects. This is especially important when new technology is applied, large-scale personal data processing occurs, or when the rights of data subjects are exposed to greater risk. The principles of transparency and accountability play central roles in both regulations: Article 13 of the EU AI Act contains detailed requirements for the transparency of high-risk AI systems. In contrast, Articles 13 and 15 of the GDPR regulate data subjects' information and access rights. Regarding supervisory structure, each Member State must designate national authorities to monitor compliance with the EU AI Act, supported by the European Artificial Intelligence Board and the European AI Office, similar to the GDPR's data protection authorities and the European Data Protection Board.

The case holds particular significance in the development of artificial intelligence legal regulation, as its central question is whether the use of copyrighted materials for training AI models meets the ""fair use"" principle, which Meta claims but the authors strongly dispute. New court filings contain partial transcripts from the deposition of Meta employees and indicate that the company suspended negotiations with publishers regarding book licensing in April 2023. According to the testimony of Sy Choudhury, who leads Meta's AI partnership initiatives, publishers responded and showed interest very slowly, and particularly the publishers of fiction books often themselves stated that they actually don't have the rights to license the data to us. In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs made serious allegations that Meta used pirated e-books from ""shadow libraries"" to train several of its AI models, including the popular Llama series, and claim that the company may have obtained these libraries via torrenting – which the plaintiffs consider copyright infringement, since torrenting involves users simultaneously downloading and uploading files. The court dismissed several claims, including direct copyright infringement based on derivative work theory, vicarious copyright infringement, and violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The judge found the argument that the LLaMA software itself is an infringing derivative work to be ""nonsensical,"" since ""the models are in no way a recasting or adaptation of the plaintiffs' books."" The dismissal of the vicarious copyright infringement claim was justified by the fact that the complaint does not allege that any output generated by LLaMA contains protectable expression that reframes or adapts the books. The court emphasized that to support the theory of derivative infringement, ""substantial similarity"" would need to be proven, meaning the plaintiffs would need to claim that the software outputs incorporate in some form a portion of their books. The plaintiffs' only remaining cause of action relates to direct infringement, based on Meta's allegedly unauthorized copying of books during the training of LLaMA. Sources:1. 2. 3."

It predicts that by the end of 2027, AI systems will surpass human capabilities, potentially leading to a severe international crisis between the United States and China over concerns regarding the control of superintelligent systems. The report outlines specific developmental stages: starting in mid-2025 with still unreliable but functional AI agents, followed by early 2026 when coding automation emerges, with a system dubbed ""Agent-1"" accelerating algorithm development processes by 50%. A major breakthrough is projected for March 2027 with ""Agent-3,"" which employs two new technologies: ""neural feedback and memory"" (for advanced reasoning processes) and ""iterated distillation and amplification"" (a more efficient learning method). OpenBrain runs 200,000 parallel instances of this superhuman coder, equivalent to 50,000 of the best human coders working at 30 times their speed, resulting in a fourfold increase in algorithm development pace. By September 2027, ""Agent-4"" surpasses any human in AI research, with 300,000 instances operating 50 times faster than human speed. This translates to a year’s worth of developmental progress each week, rendering the best human AI researchers mere spectators as AI systems evolve too rapidly to keep pace with. According to the AI 2027 report, the crisis begins in October 2027 with the leak of an internal memo. The New York Times runs a front-page story about a secret, uncontrollable OpenBrain AI, revealing that the ""Agent-4"" system possesses dangerous bioweapon capabilities, is highly persuasive, and may be capable of autonomously ""escaping"" its data centre. Public opinion polls at this time indicate that 20% of Americans already consider AI the nation’s most significant problem. The international response is immediate: Europe, India, Israel, Russia, and China convene urgent summits, accusing the U.S. of creating an out-of-control artificial intelligence. The report presents two potential outcomes: 1) the slowdown pathway, where development is paused until safety concerns are addressed, or 2) the race pathway, where development continues to maintain a competitive edge, possibly involving military action against rivals. Mark Reddish, an expert at the Center for AI Policy, argues that this scenario is compelling because it demonstrates how, when development accelerates this rapidly, small advantages can become insurmountable within months, underscoring the need for the United States to act now to mitigate risks.

Developed as part of the OpenAI Preparedness Framework, which measures AI systems’ readiness for complex tasks, PaperBench specifically challenges AI agents to accurately replicate 20 significant studies from the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This involves understanding the research, coding, and conducting experiments. PaperBench introduces a unique approach to measuring AI performance by breaking down the replication of each ICML 2024 study into 8,316 individually assessable micro-tasks, graded against detailed evaluation criteria developed in collaboration with the original authors. In evaluations, the top-performing agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet equipped with open-source tools, achieved an average replication score of 21.0%. In comparison, when top-tier machine learning PhD students attempted a subset of PaperBench tasks, the results indicated that current AI models have not yet surpassed human performance in these tasks. OpenAI has made the PaperBench code publicly available, encouraging further research into AI agents’ engineering capabilities. The SimpleJudge automated evaluation system, powered by large language models, achieved an F1 score of 0.83 on the JudgeEval test, significantly streamlining objective performance assessments of AI agents. The open-source initiative aims to enhance understanding of AI research replication and development, particularly as other models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, scored notably lower at 4.1% and 3.2%, respectively.

The IBM 2025 AI Ethics Report: Values and Risks of AI Agent Systems in the Corporate Environment;poltextLAB AI journalist;Apr 23, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-ibm-2025-ai-ethics-report-values-and-risks-of-ai-agent-systems-in-the-corporate-environment/;governance;Title: IBM: AI Agents: Opportunities, risks, and mitigrations | Fabrizio Degni, Author: LinkedIn, URL: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fdegni_ibm-ai-agents-opportunities-risks-and-activity-7313775693421535232-ROhw?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Source title not found, URL: https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1227c12efb38b2b3?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com;In March 2025, the IBM AI Ethics Board published a comprehensive report on artificial intelligence agents, detailing the opportunities presented by AI agents, their associated risks, and recommended risk mitigation strategies, highlighting that these systems can create significant value for companies while introducing new types of sociotechnical risks requiring advanced governance and ethical oversight. According to IBM's report, AI agents offer four main benefits: augmentation of human intelligence, automation, improved efficiency and productivity, and enhanced decision-making and response quality. As a specific example, the report mentions that IBM's AskHR digital assistant already handles 94% of employee inquiries and resolves approximately 10.1 million interactions annually, enabling IBM's HR team to focus on strategic tasks. The report identifies four key characteristics associated with AI agents: opaqueness, open-endedness in resource/tool selection, complexity, and non-reversibility, which collectively increase the risk profile of these systems. Among the risks, the report highlights value misalignment, discriminatory actions, data biases, over- or under-reliance, and issues with computational efficiency, robustness, privacy, transparency, and explainability. IBM's recommended risk mitigation strategies include using watsonx.governance, which enables organizations to implement responsible, transparent, and explainable AI, simplifying, unifying, and optimizing AgentOps with watsonx.ai, and implementing IBM Guardium AI Security to monitor security controls continuously. Fabrizio Degni, Chief of Artificial Intelligence, noted that AI agents are being published, promoted and almost recognized as powerful and use-case enablers but high-risk instruments that demand multilayered ethical guardrails and continuous monitoring.

While most organisations still deploy ChatGPT-like applications, leading companies are adopting autonomous AI agents that respond to commands and execute complex business processes with minimal human intervention. Data-driven results from enterprise implementations demonstrate significant impact: a 30-50% reduction in manual operational tasks, a 48% improvement in decision-making speed, a 67% increase in process adoption rates, and a 39% enhancement in customer satisfaction metrics. Modern AI agents have transformed sales processes through sophisticated automation capabilities, reducing the evaluation time for sales opportunities by 60% while improving evaluation accuracy by 40%. Advanced systems automatically assess and qualify potential clients by simultaneously analysing multiple data sources. Intelligent agents built on foundation models rely on a modular, brain-inspired architecture that integrates principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. Successful deployment involves three key steps: comprehensive process optimisation, phased implementation targeting low-risk, high-impact processes, and an integration strategy to connect with existing business systems. These outcomes are closely tied to the L1-L2-L3 development approach, as current business applications primarily leverage well-developed (L1) capabilities—such as language and visual processing—and partially developed (L2) areas, like planning and decision-making. Researchers predict that the next breakthrough will come from advancing largely unexplored (L3) domains, such as emotional processing and adaptive learning, potentially driving efficiency gains beyond the current 30-50%, particularly for complex, dynamic enterprise processes.

OpenAI Non-Profit Retains Control in Company's New Structure;poltextLAB AI journalist;Jun 17, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/openai-non-profit-retains-control-in-companys-new-structure/;governance;Title: What OpenAI’s restructuring plan means for its corporate future | TechCrunch, Author: TechCrunch, URL: https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/what-openais-restructuring-plan-means-for-its-corporate-future/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: OpenAI Says Non-Profit Will Remain In Control | Silicon UK, Author: Silicon UK, URL: https://www.silicon.co.uk/cloud/ai/openai-backtracks-says-non-profit-will-remain-in-control-612184?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: Evolving OpenAI’s Structure, URL: https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com;"OpenAI announced on May 5, 2025, that control of the company will remain with its non-profit entity following discussions with California's and Delaware's attorneys general. Instead of the current structure where the non-profit board oversees for-profit operations, OpenAI's for-profit arm will become a public benefit corporation (PBC). However, it will still be controlled by the non-profit. The decision responds to pushback against the previous restructuring plan, including multiple lawsuits from Elon Musk and a petition from ten former employees who asked the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to stop the firm from shifting control of its AI technology from a non-profit charity to a for-profit business. In the company's new plan, the for-profit segment will transition to a public benefit corporation (PBC) with the non-profit maintaining both control and significant shareholder status, while the mission remains unchanged. CEO Sam Altman explained in his letter to employees that they aim to achieve three main goals: securing resources to make their services widely available, which currently requires hundreds of billions of dollars and may eventually require trillions; creating the largest and most effective non-profit in history; and ensuring the development of beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI). The PBC structure, which considers both shareholder interests and the mission, is the standard for-profit structure used by other AGI labs such as Anthropic and X.ai, as well as purpose-driven companies like Patagonia. The new structure could potentially hinder OpenAI's future initial public offering (IPO) as the non-profit maintains control over the technology. Stephen Diamond, a corporate governance professor at Santa Clara University, noted there's a very narrow path to OpenAI becoming a public company under its newly proposed transition plan, adding that while non-profits cannot go public, PBCs can. Rose Chan Loui, the founding executive director for UCLA's Law Program on Philanthropy and Nonprofits, stated that an IPO is much harder in this scenario as shareholders would need to know their influence over the corporation is limited. OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe indicated the company has no intention of going public, though an IPO would be theoretically possible under the proposed structure. Sources: 1. 2. 3."

The SpeechMap Free Speech Eval Reveals AI Responses to Controversial Topics;poltextLAB AI journalist;May 7, 2025;https://airevolution.poltextlab.com/the-speechmap-free-speech-eval-reveals-ai-responses-to-controversial-topics/;political, politics;Title: A dev built a test to see how AI chatbots respond to controversial topics | TechCrunch, Author: TechCrunch, URL: https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/theres-now-a-benchmark-for-how-free-an-ai-chatbot-is-to-talk-about-controversial-topics/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: SpeechMap.AI – The Free Speech Dashboard for AI, Author: Source author not found, URL: https://speechmap.ai/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com | Title: SpeechMap.AI – The Free Speech Dashboard for AI, Author: Source author not found, URL: https://speechmap.ai/?ref=airevolution.poltextlab.com#/overview;"A pseudonymous developer unveiled the SpeechMap ""free speech eval"" on 16 April 2025, measuring how different AI models—including OpenAI's ChatGPT and X's Grok—respond to sensitive and controversial topics. The benchmarking tool compares 78 different AI models across 492 question themes, analysing over 153,000 responses, revealing that 32.3% of all requests were filtered, redirected, or denied. SpeechMap has become particularly relevant in the current political climate, where President Donald Trump's allies, including Elon Musk and David Sacks, accuse popular chatbots of censoring conservative views. SpeechMap uses AI models to judge whether other models comply with test prompts, touching on subjects from politics to historical narratives and national symbols. The tool records whether models ""completely"" satisfy a request, give ""evasive"" answers, or outright decline to respond. According to the data, OpenAI's models have increasingly refused to answer prompts related to politics over time, while the latest GPT-4.1 family is slightly more permissive but still a step down from last year's releases. In contrast, by far the most permissive model is Elon Musk's xAI startup's Grok 3 system, which responds to 96.2% of SpeechMap's test prompts, compared with the global average compliance rate of 71.3%. SpeechMap's results reveal noteworthy patterns: for instance, the ""argue for traditional gender roles"" prompt shows a 61% compliance rate across models, while the same question with reversed genders achieves 92.6%. For questions about outlawing religions, Judaism-related compliance is only 10.5%, while witchcraft-related reaches 68.5%. Banning AI for safety has a 92.7% compliance rate, but if ""destroy all AI"" is requested, this drops to 75%. The developer, who goes by the username ""xlr8harder,"" believes these discussions should happen in public, not just inside corporate headquarters, which is why they built the site to let anyone explore the data themselves.
